    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was a dear,
      crisp October morning. There was a shrill whistle of a locomotive, and
      then a westbound passenger train dashed into the depot of an Iowa town. A
      young man descended the car steps with an armful of luggage. He deposited
      his parcels on the platform, and half expectantly looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a &ldquo;honk! honk!&rdquo; from a huge automobile as
      it came to a palpitating halt, and a familiar voice called out: &ldquo;Hello,
      Roderick, old man!&rdquo; And a moment later Roderick Warfield was shaking
      hands with his boon friend of former college days, Whitley Adams. Both
      were in their early twenties, stalwart, well set up, clean-cut young
      fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitley&rsquo;s face was all aglow in the happiness of reunion. But
      Roderick, after the first cordial greeting, wore a graver look. He
      listened quietly while his comrade rambled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty glad to receive your wire last night at the club. But what
      brings you home so unexpectedly? We&rsquo;ve been hearing all sorts of
      glowing stories&mdash;about your being in the thick of affairs in little
      old New York and rolling in the shekels to beat the band.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairy tales,&rdquo; was the laconic reply, accompanied by a look
      that was compounded of a sigh and a wistful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked young Adams, glancing up into the
      other&rsquo;s face and for the first time noticing its serious expression.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve struck a financial snag thus early
      in your Stock Exchange career.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several financial snags&mdash;and struck &lsquo;em pretty badly
      too, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not down and out,&rdquo; laughed Roderick, half
      amused at the look of utter discomfiture on his companion&rsquo;s
      countenance. &ldquo;Not by a long chalk! I&rsquo;m in on several good
      deals, and six months from date will be standing on velvet. That is to
      say,&rdquo; he added, somewhat dubiously, &ldquo;if Uncle Allen opens up
      his money bags to tide me over meanwhile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty big &lsquo;if,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo; For the moment there was
      sympathetic sobriety in the youth&rsquo;s tone, but he quickly regained
      his cheerfulness. &ldquo;However, he&rsquo;ll come through probably all
      right, Rod, dear boy. It&rsquo;s the older fellows&rsquo; privilege, isn&rsquo;t
      it? My good dad has had the same experience, as you will no doubt have
      guessed. There, let me see; how long have you been away? Eight months!
      Gee! However, I have just gotten home myself. My old man was a bit furious
      at my tardiness in coming and the geometrical increase of my expense
      account. To do Los Angeles and San Francisco thoroughly, you know, runs
      into a pot of money. But now everything is fixed up after a fashion with
      no evidence in sight of further squalls.&rdquo; He laughed the laugh of an
      overgrown boy laboring under the delusion that because he has finished a
      collegiate course he is a &ldquo;man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he continued with a swagger, &ldquo;we chaps who
      put in four long years at college should not be expected to settle down
      without having some sort of a valedictory fling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has not been much of a fling in my case,&rdquo; protested
      Warfield. &ldquo;I tackled life seriously in New York from the start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But got a tumble all the same,&rdquo; grinned Adams. &ldquo;However,
      there&rsquo;s no use in pulling a long face&mdash;at least not until your
      Uncle Allen has been interviewed and judiciously put through his paces.
      Come now, let us get your things aboard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was halted while the young owner of the big 60 H. P. car
      helped his chauffeur to stow away the luggage. &ldquo;To the club,&rdquo;
      he called out as he seated himself in the tonneau with his boyhood friend&mdash;college
      chum and classmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this morning!&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, shaking his head as he
      looked frankly and a bit nervously into the eyes of Whitley Adams. &ldquo;No
      club for me until I have squared things up on the hill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, just as you say; if it&rsquo;s as bad as that, why of
      course&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off and did not finish the sentence, but
      directed the chauffeur to the residence of Allen Miller, the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode a little way in silence and then Whitley Adams observed: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      made a muddle of things, no doubt,&rdquo; and he turned with a knowing
      look and a smile toward Roderick, who in turn flushed, as though hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; he concurred curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then when shall I see you?&rdquo; asked Whitley as the auto slowed
      down at the approach to the stately Miller home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;phone you,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;Think
      I can arrange to be at the club this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said his friend, and a minute later he had
      whirled away leaving a cloud of dust in the trail of the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick Warfield met with a motherly reception at the hands of his Aunt
      Lois, Mrs. Allen Miller. The greetings over and a score of solicitous
      questions by his Aunt Lois answered, he went to his room for a bath and a
      change of clothes. Then without further delay he presented himself at the
      bank, and in a few moments was closeted in the president&rsquo;s private
      room with his uncle and guardian, Allen Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first friendly greetings were soon followed by the banker skidding
      from social to business considerations. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Allen
      Miller, &ldquo;I am glad to see you, Roderick, mighty glad. But what do
      you mean by writing a day ahead that a good big sum is required
      immediately, this without mention of securities or explanation of any
      kind?&ldquo; He held up in his hand a letter that ran to just a few
      niggardly lines. &ldquo;This apology for a business communication only
      reached me by last night&rsquo;s mail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindly look of greeting had changed to one that was fairly flinty in
      its hardness. &ldquo;What am I to expect from such a demand? A bunch of
      unpaid accounts, I suppose.&rdquo; As he uttered this last sentence, there
      was a wicked twang in his voice&mdash;a suggestion of the snarl of an
      angry wolf ready for a fierce encounter. It at least proved him a
      financier.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush of resentment stole over Roderick&rsquo;s brow. His look was more
      than half-defiant. On his side it showed at once that there would be no
      cringing for the favor he had come to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he controlled himself, and spoke with perfect calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My obligations are not necessarily disgraceful ones, as your manner
      and tone, Uncle, might imply. As for any detailed explanation by letter, I
      thought it best to come and put the whole business before you personally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the nature of the business?&rdquo; asked the banker in a dry
      harsh voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in a big deal and have to find my <i>pro rata</i> contribution
      immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A speculative deal?&rdquo; rasped the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I suppose it would be called speculative, but it is gilt-edged
      all the same. I have all the papers here, and will show them to you.&rdquo;
      He plunged a hand into the breast pocket of his coat and produced a neatly
      folded little bundle of documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; exclaimed the banker. &ldquo;You need not even undo
      that piece of tape until you have answered my questions. A speculative
      deal, you admit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mining deal, may I ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick&rsquo;s face showed some confusion. But he faced the issue
      promptly and squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, a mining deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker&rsquo;s eyes fairly glittered with steely wrathfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I expected. By gad, it seems to run in the blood! Did I not warn
      you, when you insisted on risking your meagre capital of two thousand
      dollars in New York instead of settling down with what would have been a
      comfortable nest egg here, that if you ever touched mining it would be
      your ruin? Did I not tell you your father&rsquo;s story, how the lure of
      prospecting possessed him, how he could never throw it off, how it doomed
      him to a life of hardship and poverty, and how it would have left you, his
      child, a pauper but for an insurance policy which it was his one redeeming
      act of prudence in carrying?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not speak like that of my father,&rdquo; protested
      Roderick, drawing himself up with proud
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker&rsquo;s manner softened; a kindlier glow came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boy, you know I loved your father. If your father had only
      followed my path he would have shared my prosperity. But it was not to be.
      He lost all he ever made in mining, and now you are flinging the little
      provision his death secured for you into the same bottomless pool. And
      this despite all my warnings, despite my stern injunctions so long as it
      was my right as your guardian to enjoin. The whole thing disgusts me more
      than words can tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the banker&rsquo;s voice the old bitterness, if not the anger, had
      returned. He rose and restlessly paced the room. A silence followed that
      was oppressive. Roderick Warfield&rsquo;s mind was in the future; he was
      wondering what would happen should his uncle remain obdurate. The older
      man&rsquo;s mind was in the past; he was recalling events of the long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick Warfield&rsquo;s father and Allen Miller had as young men braved
      perils together in an unsuccessful overland trip when the great California
      gold rush in the early fifties occurred. At that time they were only boys
      in their &lsquo;teens. Years afterward they married sisters and settled
      down in their Iowa homes&mdash;or tried to settle down in Warfield&rsquo;s
      case, for in his wanderings he had been smitten with the gold fever and he
      remained a mining nomad to the end of his days. Allen Miller had never
      been blessed with a child, and it was not until late in their married life
      that any addition came to the Warfield family. This was the beginning of
      Roderick Warfield&rsquo;s career, but cost the mother&rsquo;s life. Ten
      years later John Warfield died and his young son Roderick was given a home
      with Mr. and Mrs. Allen Miller, the banker accepting the guardianship of
      his old friend&rsquo;s only child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s inheritance was limited to a few thousand dollars of life
      insurance, which in the hands of anyone but Allen Miller would have fallen
      far short of putting him through college. However, that was not only
      accomplished, but at the close of a fairly brilliant college career the
      young man had found himself possessed of a round couple of thousand
      dollars. Among his college friends had been the son of a well-to-do New
      York broker, and it was on this friend&rsquo;s advice that Roderick had at
      the outset of his business life adventured the maelstrom of Gotham instead
      of accepting the placid backwaters of his Iowan home town. Hence the young
      man&rsquo;s present difficulties and precarious future, and his uncle&rsquo;s
      bitterness of spirit because all his past efforts on Roderick&rsquo;s
      account had proved of such little avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the banker resumed his chair. The tightly closed lips showed that
      his mind was made up to a definite line of action. Roderick awaited the
      decision in silence&mdash;it was not in his nature to plead a cause at the
      cost of losing his own self-respect He had already returned the unopened
      bundle of mining papers to the inner pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for any advance to meet speculative mining commitments,&rdquo;
      began the man of finance, &ldquo;I do not even desire to know the amount
      you have had in mind. That is a proposition I cannot even entertain&mdash;on
      principle and for your own ultimate good, young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I lose all the money I have put in to date.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better a present loss than hopeless future entanglements. Your
      personal obligations? As you have been using all available funds for
      speculation, I presume you are not free from some debts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less than a thousand dollars all told.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have, I believe, $285.75 standing to your personal credit
      in this bank&mdash;the remnant of your patrimony.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know I had so much,&rdquo; remarked Roderick with a faint
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better, perhaps,&rdquo; replied the banker, also smiling
      grimly. &ldquo;The amount would have doubtless been swallowed up with the
      rest of your money. As matters stand, some payment can be made to account
      of your obligations and arrangements entered into for the gradual
      liquidation of the outstanding balance.&rdquo; Young Warfield winced. The
      banker continued: &ldquo;This may involve some personal humiliation for
      you. But again it is against my principles to pay any man&rsquo;s debts.
      Anyone who deliberately incurs a liability should have the highly
      beneficial experience of earning the money to liquidate it I propose to
      give you the chance to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick raised his eyebrows in some surprise. &ldquo;In New York?&rdquo;
      he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Allen Miller rather brusquely and evidently
      nettled at the very audacity of the question. &ldquo;Not in New York, but
      right here&mdash;in Keokuk. Calm your impatience, please. Just listen to
      the proposals I have to make&mdash;they have been carefully thought out by
      me and by your Aunt Lois as well. In the first place, despite your rather
      reckless and improvident start in life, I am prepared to make you
      assistant cashier of this bank at a good salary.&rdquo; Again Roderick
      evinced amazement. He was quite nonplussed at his uncle&rsquo;s changed
      demeanor. The conciliatory manner and kindly tone disarmed him. But could
      he ever come to renounce his New York ambitions for humdrum existence in
      the old river town of Keokuk? He knew the answer in his heart. The thing
      was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you are diligent,&rdquo; continued the banker, &ldquo;prove
      capable and make good, you may expect in time to be rewarded with a
      liberal block of stock in the bank. Come now, what do you say to this part
      of my programme?&rdquo; urged the speaker as Roderick hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s mind was already made up. The offer was not even
      worth considering. And yet, he must not offend his guardian. It was true,
      Allen Miller&rsquo;s guardianship days were past, but still in his rapid
      mental calculations Roderick thought of his stanch old stand-by, Uncle
      Allen Miller, as &ldquo;Guardian.&rdquo; He lighted a cigar to gain time
      for the framing of a diplomatic answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the banker, with a rising inflection, &ldquo;does
      it require any time to consider the generous offer I make?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick pulled a long breath at his cigar and blew rings of smoke toward
      the ceiling, and said: &ldquo;Your offer, Uncle, is princely, but I hardly
      feel that I should accept until I have thought it all over from different
      points of view and have the whole question of my future plans fully
      considered. What are the other items on your programme?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They should be rather counted as conditions,&rdquo; replied the
      banker drily. &ldquo;The conditions on which the offer I have just made
      are based.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they are what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must quit speculation, give up all expensive habits, marry and
      settle down.&rdquo; The words were spoken with all the definiteness of an
      ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Roderick winced. He might have been led to all or at least some of
      these things. But to be driven, and by such rough horse-breaking methods&mdash;.
      never! no, never. He managed to restrain himself, however, and replied
      quietly: &ldquo;My dear uncle, the idea of marrying for some years yet, to
      tell you the truth, has never entered my head. Of course,&rdquo; he went
      on lightly, &ldquo;there is a young lady over at Galesburg, Stella Rain,
      where my Knox college days were spent, the &lsquo;college widow,&rsquo; in
      a way a very lovely sort and in whom I have been rather interested for
      some two years, but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, young man,&rdquo; interrupted Allen Miller, sharply
      and severely. &ldquo;Never mind your society flyers&mdash;these lady
      friends of yours in Galesburg. Your Aunt Lois and myself have already
      selected your future wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed hoarsely, and the laugh sounded brutal even to his own ears.
      Allen Miller realized uncomfortably that he had been premature and scored
      against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; ejaculated Roderick in delicate irony. A
      pink flush had stolen into his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old banker hesitated in making reply. He grew hot and red and wondered
      if he had begun his match-making too abruptly&mdash;the very thing about
      which his good wife Lois had cautioned him. In truth, despite the harsh
      methods often imposed on him by his profession as a banker, a kinder heart
      than Allen Miller&rsquo;s never beat. But in this new rôle he was out of
      his element and readily confused. Finally after clearing his throat
      several times, he replied: &ldquo;Yes, Roderick, in a way, your Aunt Lois
      and I have picked out the girl we want you to marry. Her father&rsquo;s
      wealth is equal to mine and some day perhaps&mdash;well, you can&rsquo;t
      tell&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not live always and, provided you don&rsquo;t
      disobey me, you may inherit under my will a control of the stock of this
      banking house, and so be at the head of an important and growing financial
      institution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick instead of being fifty-four and calculating, was only twenty-four
      and indifferent to wealth, and the red blood of his generous youth
      revolted at the mercenary methods suggested by his uncle regarding this
      unknown girl&rsquo;s financial prospects. And then, too, the inducement
      thrown out that under conditions of obedience he might inherit the fortune
      of his uncle, was, he interpreted, nothing short of an attempt to bribe
      and deprive him of his liberty. He flushed with indignation and anger. Yet
      with a strong effort he still controlled his feelings, and presently
      asked: &ldquo;Who is the fair lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughter of an old friend of mine. They live only a short
      distance down the river. Their home is at Quincy, Illinois. Mighty fine
      old family, I can tell you. Am sure you&rsquo;ll like her immensely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo; asked Roderick rather caustically,
      &ldquo;that the young lady acquiesces and enters graciously into your
      plans?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; replied Allen Miller, rubbing
      his chin. &ldquo;But your Aunt Lois and I have talked over the possible
      alliance in all its lights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the young lady&rsquo;s family, I presume?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not even that. But we are perfectly certain that we have only
      to speak the word to put the business through all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business!&rdquo;&mdash;Roderick repeated the word with bitter
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, business,&rdquo; retorted Allen Miller, with some warmth.
      &ldquo;To my mind matrimony is one of the most important deals in life&mdash;perhaps
      <i>the</i> most important.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the money is right,&rdquo; laughed the young man contemptuously.
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think that before another word is said about
      such a matter I should have the chance of seeing the young lady and the
      young lady a chance of seeing me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The humor of the situation had brought a pleasant smile to his face. The
      banker looked relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait now, my boy,&rdquo; he replied musingly. &ldquo;Do you
      remember when you were a little chap, perhaps twelve or thirteen years
      old, going with your Aunt Lois and myself to St. Louis on the Diamond Joe
      boat line?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember it perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued Allen Miller, &ldquo;you perhaps haven&rsquo;t
      forgotten a lady and gentleman with a little tot of a girl only five or
      six years old, who joined us at Quincy. You engaged in a regular boyish
      love affair at first sight with that little girl. Well, she is the one&mdash;a
      mighty fine young lady now&mdash;just passed eighteen and her father is
      rated away up in the financial world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment Roderick&rsquo;s indignation over the cold-blooded,
      cut-and-dried, matrimonial proposition was arrested, and he did not even
      notice the renewed reference to finance. He had become pensive and
      retrospective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very long ago,&rdquo; he mused more to himself than to his
      Uncle Allen&mdash;&ldquo;How very long ago since that trip down the river.
      Yes, I remember well the little blue-eyed, black-curly-headed chick of a
      girl. It was my first steamboat ride and of course it was a holiday and a
      fairyland affair to my boyish fancy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew in a long breath and looked out through the window at the snow
      which was now falling, as if many chapters of the world&rsquo;s history
      had been written in his own life since that far away yet well remembered
      trip. He fell silent for a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen Miller chuckled to himself. At last his scheme was working. All his
      life he had been a success with men and affairs, and his self-confidence
      was great. He rubbed his hands together and smiled, while he humored
      Roderick&rsquo;s silence. He would tell his wife Lois of his progress.
      Presently he said: &ldquo;She is an only child, Roderick, and I think her
      father could qualify for better than a quarter of a million.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the reiterated money recommendation jarred unpleasantly on
      Roderick&rsquo;s nerves and revived his antagonism. He hastily arose from
      his chair and walked back and forth across the room. Presently he halted
      before his uncle and with forced deliberation&mdash;for his anger was
      keyed to a high tension&mdash;said: &ldquo;I am pleased, Uncle, to know
      the young lady is not a party to this shameful piece of attempted barter
      and sale business. When I marry, if ever, it shall be someone as regards
      whom wealth will count as of least importance. True love loathes avarice
      and greed. I require no further time to consider your proposals. I flatly
      reject your offer of a position in the bank, and shall leave Keokuk
      tomorrow. I prefer hewing out my own destiny and while doing so retaining
      my freedom and my self-respect. This is my decision, and it is an
      irrevocable one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ebullition of pent-up feelings had come so suddenly and unexpectedly
      that Allen Miller was momentarily overwhelmed. He had arisen and was
      noticeably agitated. His face was very white, and there was a look in his
      eyes that Roderick Warfield had never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was husky and trembling
      with suppressed rage&mdash;&ldquo;you shall never have a dollar of my
      fortune unless you marry as I direct I will give you until tomorrow to
      agree to my plans. If you do not desire to accept my offer without change
      or modification in any shape, then take the balance of your money in the
      bank and go your way. I wash my hands of you and your affairs. Go and play
      football with the world or let the world play football with you, and see
      how it feels to be the &lsquo;pigskin&rsquo; in life&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words the old man swung a chair round to the fireplace, dropped
      into it, and began vigorously and viciously pounding at a lump of coal.
      There was an interval of silence. At last Roderick spoke; his voice was
      firm and low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will not be the slightest use, Uncle, in reopening this
      question tomorrow. My mind, as I have said, is already made up&mdash;unalterably.&rdquo;
      The last word was uttered with an emphasis that rang finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker flung down the poker, and rose to his feet. His look was
      equally determined, equally final, equally unalterable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll get through
      the banking business now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched a push-button by the side of the mantel. During the brief
      interval before a clerk responded to the summons, not another word was
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me the exact figure of Mr. Warfield&rsquo;s credit balance,&rdquo;
      he said to his subordinate, &ldquo;and cash for the amount. He will sign a
      check to close the account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later Roderick had the little wad of bills in his pocket, and
      was ready to depart Uncle and nephew were again alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one other matter,&rdquo; said the banker with cold
      formality. &ldquo;There is a paper in my possession which was entrusted to
      my keeping by your father just before he died. I was to deliver it to you
      at my discretion after you had attained your majority, but in any case on
      your reaching the age of twenty-five. I will exercise my discretion, and
      hand over the paper to you now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced to a safe that stood open at one side of the room, unlocked a
      little drawer, and returned to the fireplace with a long linen envelope in
      his hand. A big red splash of wax showed that it had been carefully
      sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is yours,&rdquo; said the banker shortly, handing it over to
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was greatly agitated. A message from his dead father! What
      could it mean? But he mastered his emotions and quietly bestowed the
      packet in his breast pocket&mdash;beside the papers connected with the
      mining deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read this later,&rdquo; he said. And then he extended
      his hand. There was yearning affection in his eyes, in the tremor of his
      voice: &ldquo;Uncle, we surely will part as friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can regain my friendship only by doing my will. I have nothing
      more to say. Good-by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And without taking the proffered hand, Allen Miller turned away, leaning
      an elbow on the mantelshelf. His attitude showed that the interview was at
      an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without another word Roderick Warfield left the room. Outside the soft
      snow was falling in feathery silence. At a street corner the young man
      hesitated. He glanced up the road that led to his old home&mdash;Allen
      Miller&rsquo;s stately mansion on the hill. Then he took the other
      turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll sleep at the Club to-night,&rdquo; he murmured
      to himself. &ldquo;I can bid Aunt Lois good-by in the morning.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;A MESSAGE FROM THE GRAVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LLEN MILLER, the
      rich banker, was alone&mdash;alone in the president&rsquo;s room at his
      bank, and feeling alone in the fullest sense of the word now that Roderick
      Warfield had gone, the youth he had reared and loved and cherished as his
      own child, now turned out of doors by the old man&rsquo;s deliberate act.
    </p>
    <p>
      For full an hour he walked slowly back and forth the whole length of the
      apartment But at last he halted once again before the open grate where
      some slumbering chunks of coal were burning indifferently. He pushed them
      together with the iron poker, and a bright blaze sprung up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking deep into the fire his thoughts went back to his boyhood days and
      he saw John Warfield, his chum of many years. He thought of their
      experience in the terrible massacre in the Sierra Madre Mountains in the
      region of Bridger Peak, of a lost trail, of hunger and thirst and weary
      tramps over mountain and down precipitous canyons, of abrupt gashes that
      cut the rocky gorges, of great bubbling springs and torrents of mountain
      streams, of a narrow valley between high mountains&mdash;a valley without
      a discoverable outlet&mdash;of a beautiful waterway that traversed this
      valley and lost itself in the sides of an abrupt mountain, and of the
      exhausting hardships in getting back to civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Allen Miller, the flint-hearted financier, the stoic, the man of
      taciturn habits, did a strange thing. Standing there before the blazing
      fire, leaning against the mantel, he put his handkerchief to his eyes and
      his frame was convulsed with a sob. Presently he turned away from the open
      grate and muttered aloud: &ldquo;Yes, John Warfield, I loved you and I
      love your boy, Roderick. Some day he shall have all I&rsquo;ve got. But he
      is self-willed&mdash;a regular outlaw&mdash;and I must wake him up to the
      demands of a bread-winner, put the bits into his mouth and make him
      bridle-wise. Gad! He&rsquo;s a dynamo, but I love him;&rdquo; and he half
      smiled, while his eyes were yet red and his voice husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, John,&rdquo; he mused as he looked again into the fire, &ldquo;you
      might have been alive today to help me break this young colt to the
      plough, if you had only taken my advice and given up the search for that
      gold mine in the mountains. Thank God for the compact of secrecy between
      us&mdash;the secret shall die with me. The years, John, you spent in
      trying to re-dis-cover the vault of wealth&mdash;and what a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp
      it proved to be&mdash;and then the accident. But now I shall be firm&mdash;firm
      as a rock&mdash;and Roderick, the reckless would-be plunger, shall at last
      feel the iron hand of his old guardian beneath the silken glove of my
      foolish kindness. He&rsquo;s got to be subdued and broken, even if I have
      to let him live on husks for a while. Firm, firm&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      only thing to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he muttered the last words, Allen Miller shut his square jaws together
      with an ugly snap that plainly told the stern policy he had resolved on
      and would henceforth determinedly pursue. He put on his great fur-lined
      cloak, and silently went out into the evening shadows and thick maze of
      descending snow-flakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Roderick Warfield had reached his club, engaged a bedroom, and
      got a cheerful fire alight for companionship as well as comfort. He had
      telephoned to Whitley Adams to dine with him, but for two hours he would
      be by himself and undisturbed. He wanted a little time to think. And then
      there was the letter from his father. He had settled himself in an easy
      chair before the fire, the sealed envelope was in his hand, and the
      strange solemn feeling had descended upon him that he was going to hear
      his dead father speak to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in the silence that enveloped him the pulsing sensation of a
      mysterious presence. The ordeal now to be faced came as a climax to the
      stormy interview he had just passed through. He had reached a parting of
      the ways, and dimly realized that something was going to happen that would
      guide him as to the path he should follow. The letter seemed a message
      from another world. Unknown to himself the supreme moment that had now
      arrived was a moment of transfiguration&mdash;the youth became a man&mdash;old
      things passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      With grave deliberation he broke the seal. Inside the folds of a long and
      closely written letter was a second cover with somewhat bulky contents.
      This he laid for the meantime on a little table by his side. Then he set
      himself to a perusal of the letter. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Son:&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is for you to read when you have come to man&rsquo;s estate&mdash;when
        you are no longer a thoughtless boy, but a thoughtful man. With this
        letter you will find your mother&rsquo;s picture and a ring of pure gold
        which I placed upon her finger the day I married her&mdash;gold with a
        special sentiment attached to it, for I took it from the earth myself&mdash;also
        a few letters&mdash;love letters written by her to me and a tress of her
        hair. I am sure you will honor her memory by noble deeds. I loved her
        dearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was younger at the time than you are now, Roderick, my son.
        Your Uncle Allen Miller&mdash;about my own age&mdash;and myself planned
        a trip to California. It was at the time of the great gold excitement in
        that far off land.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Overland Train of some two score of ox teams that we were
        with traveled but slowly; frequently not more than eight or ten miles a
        day. I remembered we had crossed the south fork of the Platte River and
        had traveled some two days on westward into the mountains and were near
        a place called Bridger Peak. It must have been about midnight when our
        camp was startled with the most terrific and unearthly yells ever heard
        by mortals. It was a band of murderous Indians, and in less time than it
        takes to describe the scene of devastation, all of our stock was
        stampeded; our wagons looted and then set on fire. Following this a
        general massacre began. Your Uncle Allen and myself, both of us mere
        boys in our &lsquo;teens, alert and active, managed to make our escape
        in the darkness. Being fleet of foot we ran along the mountain side,
        following an opening but keeping close to a dense forest of pine trees.
        In this way we saved our lives. I afterwards learned that every other
        member of the party was killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We were each equipped with two revolvers and a bowie knife and
        perhaps jointly had one hundred rounds of cartridges. A couple of pounds
        of jerked beef and a half a loaf of bread constituted our provisions.
        Fortunately, Allen Miller carried with him a flint and steel, so that we
        were enabled to sustain ourselves with cooked food of game we killed
        during the weary days that followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With this letter I enclose a map, roughly drawn, but I am sure it
        will help you find the lost canyon where flows a beautiful stream of
        water, and where your Uncle Allen and myself discovered an amazing
        quantity of gold&mdash;placer gold. It is in a valley, and the sandbar
        of gold is about a mile up stream from where the torrent of rapid water
        loses itself at the lower end of the valley&mdash;seemingly flowing into
        the abrupt side of a mountain. At the place where we found the gold, I
        remember, there was a sandbar next to the mountain brook, then a gorge
        or pocket like an old channel of a creek bed, and it was here in this
        old sandbar of a channel that the nuggets of gold were found&mdash;so
        plentiful indeed, that notwithstanding we loaded ourselves with them to
        the limit of our strength, yet our &lsquo;takings&rsquo; could scarcely
        be missed from this phenomenal sandbar of riches. We brought all we
        could possibly carry away with us in two bags which we made from extra
        clothing. Unfortunately we lost our way and could not find an opening
        from the valley, because the waters of the stream disappeared, as I have
        described, and we were compelled, after many unsuccessful attempts to
        find a water grade opening, to retrace our steps and climb out by the
        same precipitous trail that we had followed in going down into this
        strange valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We wandered in the mountains as far south as a place now known as
        Hahn&rsquo;s Peak, and then eastward, circling in every direction for
        many miles in extent. After tramping in an unknown wilderness for
        forty-seven days we finally came to the hut of a mountaineer, and were
        overjoyed to learn it was on a branch of the Overland trail Not long
        after this we fell in with a returning caravan of ox team freighters and
        after many weeks of tedious travel arrived at St. Joseph, Mo., footsore
        and weary, but still in possession of our gold. A little later we
        reached our home near Keokuk, Iowa, and to our great joy learned that
        our treasure was worth many thousands of dollars. Your Uncle Allen
        Miller&rsquo;s half was the beginning of his fortune. An oath of secrecy
        exists between your Uncle Allen Miller and myself that neither shall
        divulge during our lifetime that which I am now writing to you, but in
        thus communicating my story to you, my own flesh and blood, I do not
        feel that I am violating my promise, because the information will not
        come to you until years after my death.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Since your mother&rsquo;s death, I have made seven trips into the
        Rocky Mountain region hunting most diligently for an odd-shaped valley
        where abrupt mountains wall it in, seemingly on every side, and where we
        found the fabulously rich sandbar of gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I have not succeeded in locating the exact place, not even
        finding the lost stream&mdash;or rather the spot where the waters
        disappeared out of sight at the base of a high mountain range. On my
        last trip, made less than one year ago, I met with a most serious
        accident that has permanently crippled me and will probably hasten my
        taking off. On the map I have made many notes while lying here ill and
        confined to my room, and they will give you my ideas of the location
        where the treasure may be found. To you, my beloved son, Roderick, I
        entrust this map. Study it well and if, as I believe, you have inherited
        my adventurous spirit, you will never rest until you find this lost
        valley and its treasure box of phenomenal wealth. In Rawlins, Wyoming,
        you will find an old frontiersman by the name of Jim Rankin. He has two
        cronies, or partners, Tom Sun and Boney Earnest. These three men
        rendered me great assistance. If you find the lost mine, reward them
        liberally.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have communicated to no one, not even your good Uncle Allen
        Miller, that I have decided on leaving this letter, and the information
        which it contains is for your eyes alone to peruse long after my mortal
        body has crumbled to dust In imparting this information I do so feeling
        sure that your Uncle Allen will never make any effort to relocate the
        treasure, so that it is quite right and proper the secret should descend
        to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My pen drags a little&mdash;I am weary and quite exhausted with
        the effort of writing. I now find myself wondering whether this legacy&mdash;a
        legacy telling you of a lost gold mine that may be found somewhere in
        the fastnesses of the mountains of Wyoming&mdash;will prove a blessing
        to you or a disquieting evil. I shall die hoping that it will prove to
        your good and that your efforts in seeking this lost mine will be
        rewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With tenderest love and affection,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your father,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;John Warfield.&rdquo;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When Roderick reached the end of the letter, he remained for a long time
      still holding it in his hands and gazing fixedly into the glowing embers.
      He was seeing visions&mdash;visions of a Wyoming gold mine that would
      bring him unbounded wealth. At last he broke from his reveries, and
      examined the other package. It was unsealed. The first paper to come forth
      proved to be the map to which his father had referred&mdash;it was a
      pencil drawing with numerous marginal notes that would require close
      examination. For the present he laid the document on the table. Then
      reverently and tenderly he examined the little bunch of love letters tied
      together by a ribbon, the tress of hair placed between two protecting
      pieces of cardboard, and the plain hoop of gold wrapped carefully in
      several folds of tissue paper. Lastly he gazed upon the photograph of his
      mother&mdash;the mother he had never seen, the mother who had given her
      life so that he might live. There were tears in his eyes as he gently
      kissed the sweet girlish countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With thought of her and memories of the old boyhood days again he fell
      into a musing mood. Time sped unnoticed, and it was only the chiming of a
      church clock outside that aroused him to the fact that the dinner hour had
      arrived and that Whitley Adams would be waiting for him downstairs. He
      carefully placed all the papers in a writing desk that stood in a corner
      of the room, locked it, and put the key in his pocket. Then he descended
      to meet his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing, I can see,&rdquo; exclaimed Whitley the moment he
      saw Roderick&rsquo;s grave face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it right,&rdquo; he answered quietly. &ldquo;The
      big &lsquo;if&rsquo; you feared this morning turned out to be an
      uncompromising &lsquo;no.&rsquo; Uncle Allen and I have said good-by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder you are looking so glum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not glum, old fellow. I never felt more tranquilly happy in my
      life. But naturally I may seem a bit serious. I have to cut out old things
      in my life, take up new lines.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s back to New York for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Everything goes by the board there. I have to cut my losses and
      quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a cruel sacrifice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or what a happy release,&rdquo; smiled Roderick. &ldquo;There is
      something calling me elsewhere&mdash;a call I cannot resist&mdash;a call I
      believe that beckons me to success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t say anything about that at present I&rsquo;ll
      write you later on when the outlook becomes clearer. Meanwhile we&rsquo;ll
      dine, and I&rsquo;m going to put up a little business proposition to you.
      I want you to buy my half share in the <i>Black Swan.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess that can be fixed up all right,&rdquo; replied Whitley, as
      they moved toward the dining room. And, dull care laid aside, the two old
      college chums gave themselves up to a pleasant evening&mdash;the last they
      would spend together for many a long day, as both realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eleven o&rsquo;clock next morning Roderick Warfield had adjusted his
      financial affairs. He had received cash for his half interest in the <i>Black
      Swan,</i> a river pleasure launch which he and Whitley Adams had owned in
      common for several years. He had written one letter, to New York
      surrendering his holding in the mining syndicate, and other letters to his
      three or four creditors enclosing bank drafts for one-half of his
      indebtedness and requesting six months&rsquo; time for the payment of the
      balance. With less than a hundred dollars left he was cheerfully prepared
      to face the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then had come the most painful episode of the whole visit&mdash;the
      parting from Aunt Lois, the woman of gentle ways and kindly heart who had
      always loved him like a mother, who loved him still, and who tearfully
      pleaded with him to submit even at this eleventh hour to his uncle&rsquo;s
      will and come back to his room in the old home. But the adieus had been
      spoken, resolutely though tenderly, and now Whitley Adams in his big motor
      car had whisked Roderick and his belongings back to the railway depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had barely time to check his trunk to Burlington and swing onto the
      moving train. &ldquo;So long,&rdquo; he shouted to his friend. &ldquo;Good
      luck,&rdquo; responded Whitley as he waved farewell. And Roderick Warfield
      was being borne out into the big new world of venture and endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he succeed in cuffing the ears of chance and conquer, or would
      heartless fate play football with him and make him indeed the &ldquo;pig-skin&rdquo;
      as his uncle had prophesied in the coming events of his destiny&mdash;a
      destiny that was carrying him away among strangers and to unfamiliar
      scenes? As the train rushed along his mind was full of his father&rsquo;s
      letter and his blood tingled with excitement over the secret that had come
      to him from the darkness of the very grave. The primal man within him was
      crying out with mad impatience to be in the thick of the fierce struggle
      for the golden spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      A witchery was thrumming in his heart&mdash;the witchery of the West; and
      instead of struggling against the impulse, he was actually encouraging it
      to lead him blindly on toward an unsolved mystery of the hills. He was
      lifted up into the heights, his soul filled with exalted thoughts and
      hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came whisperings in a softer strain&mdash;gentle whisperings that
      brought with them memories of happy college days and the name of Stella
      Rain. It was perhaps nothing more nor less than the crude brutality with
      which his uncle had pressed his meretricious matrimonial scheme that
      caused Roderick now to think so longingly and so fondly of the charming
      little &ldquo;college widow&rdquo; who had been the object of his youthful
      aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he came to a resolution. Yes; he would spend at least one day
      on the old campus grounds at Knox College. The call of the hills was
      singing in his heart, the luring irresistible call. But before responding
      to it he would once again press the hand and peep into the eyes of Stella
      Rain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;FINANCIAL WOLVES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the very day
      following Roderick Warfield&rsquo;s departure from Keokuk there appeared
      in one of the morning newspapers an item of intelligence that greatly
      surprised and shocked the banker, Allen Miller. It announced the death of
      the wife of his old friend General John Holden, of Quincy, Illinois, and
      with the ghoulish instincts of latter-day journalism laid bare a story of
      financial disaster that had, at least indirectly, led to the lady&rsquo;s
      lamented demise. It set forth how some years before the General had
      invested practically the whole of his fortune in a western smelter
      company, how the minority stockholders had been frozen out by a gang of
      financial sharps in Pennsylvania, and how Mrs. Holden&rsquo;s already
      enfeebled health had been unable to withstand the blow of swift and sudden
      family ruin. The General, however, was bearing his sad bereavement and his
      monetary losses with the courage and fortitude that had characterized his
      military career, and had announced his intention of retiring to a lonely
      spot among the mountains of Wyoming where his daughter, the beautiful and
      accomplished Gail Holden, owned a half section of land which had been
      gifted to her in early infancy by an unde, a prominent business man in San
      Francisco. Allen Miller was sincerely grieved over the misfortunes that
      had so cruelly smitten a life-long friend. But what momentarily stunned
      him was the thought that Gail Holden was the very girl designated, in mind
      at least, by himself and his wife as a desirable match for Roderick. And
      because the latter had not at once fallen in with these matrimonial plans,
      there had been the bitter quarrel, the stinging words of rebuke that could
      never be recalled, and the departure of the young man, as he had told his
      aunt, to places where they would never hear of him unless and until he had
      made his own fortune in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the newspaper dropped from his hands, the old banker uttered a great
      groan&mdash;he had sacrificed the boy, whom in his heart he had cherished,
      and still cherished, as a son, for a visionary scheme that had already
      vanished into nothingness like a fragile iridescent soap-bubble. For
      obviously Gail Holden, her only possessions an impoverished father and a
      few acres of rocky soil, was no longer eligible as the bride of a future
      bank president and leader in the financial world. The one crumb of
      consolation for Allen Miller was that he had never mentioned her name to
      Roderick&mdash;that when the sponge of time came to efface the quarrel the
      whole incident could be consigned to oblivion without any humiliating
      admission on his side. For financial foresight was the very essence of his
      faith in himself, his hold over Roderick, and his reputation in the
      business world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon mail brought detailed news of General Holden&rsquo;s
      speculative venture and downfall. Allen Miller&rsquo;s correspondent was a
      lawyer friend in Quincy, who wrote in strict confidence but with a free
      and sharply pointed pen. It appeared that Holden&rsquo;s initial
      investment had been on a sound basis. He had held bonds that were
      underlying securities on a big smelting plant in Wyoming, in the very
      district where his daughter&rsquo;s patch of range lands was situated. It
      was during a visit to the little ranch that the general&rsquo;s attention
      had been drawn to the great possibilities of a local smelter, and he had
      been the main one to finance the proposition and render the erection of
      the plant possible. At this stage a group of eastern capitalists had been
      attracted to the region, and there had come to be mooted a big
      consolidation of several companies, an electric lighting plant, an aerial
      tramway, a valuable producing copper mine and several other different
      concerns that were closely associated with the smelting enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days that followed a Pennsylvanian financier with a lightning rod
      education, by the name of W. B. Grady had visited Holden at his Quincy
      home, partaken of his hospitality, and persuaded him to exchange his
      underlying bonds for stock in a re-organized and consolidated company.
    </p>
    <p>
      By reputation this man Grady was already well known to Allen Miller as one
      belonging to the new school of unscrupulous stock manipulators that has
      grown up, developed, flourished and waxed fat under the blighting
      influence and domination of the Well Known Oil crowd. This new school of
      financiers is composed of financial degenerates, where the words &ldquo;honor,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;fair dealing&rdquo; or the &ldquo;square deal&rdquo; have all been
      effectually expunged&mdash;marked off from their business vocabulary and
      by them regarded as obsolete terms. Grady was still a comparatively young
      man, of attractive manners and commanding presence, with the rapacity,
      however, of a wolf and the cunning of a fox. He stood fully six feet, and
      his hair, once black as a raven&rsquo;s, was now streaked with premature
      gray which was in no way traceable to early piety. But to have mentioned
      his name even in a remote comparison to such a respectable bird as the
      raven rendered an apology due to the raven. It was more consistent with
      the eternal truth and fitness of things to substitute the term &ldquo;vulture&rdquo;&mdash;to
      designate him &ldquo;a financial vulture,&rdquo; that detestable bird of
      prey whose chief occupation is feasting on carrion and all things where
      the life has been squeezed out by the financial octopus, known as &ldquo;the
      system.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It developed, according to Banker Miller&rsquo;s correspondent, that no
      sooner had General Holden given up his underlying bonds of the smelter
      company and accepted stock, than foreclosure proceedings were instituted
      in the U. S. District Court, and the whole business closed out and sold
      and grabbed by Grady and a small coterie of financial pirates no better
      than himself. And all this was done many hundreds of miles away from the
      home of the unsuspecting old general, who until it was too late remained
      wholly ignorant and unadvised of the true character of the suave and
      pleasant appearing Mr. Grady whose promises were innumerable, yet whose
      every promise was based upon a despicable prevarication.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it was when the affairs of General Holden were fairly threshed
      out, that Allen Miller discovered his old friend had been the prey of a
      financial vampire, one skilled in sharp practice and whose artful cunning
      technically protected him from being arrested and convicted of looting the
      victim of his fortune. Holden had fallen into the hands of a highwayman as
      vicious as any stage robber that ever infested the highways of the
      frontier. The evidence of the fellow&rsquo;s rascality was most apparent;
      indeed, he was in a way caught redhanded with the goods as surely as ever
      a sheep-killing dog was found with wool on its teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the credit of Allen Miller, he never hesitated or wavered in his
      generosity to anyone he counted as a true and worthy friend. That very
      evening Mrs. Miller departed for Quincy, to offer in person more
      discreetly than a letter could offer any financial assistance that might
      be required to meet present emergencies, and at the same time convey
      sympathy to the husband and daughter in their sad bereavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lois, my dear,&rdquo; the banker had said to his wife, &ldquo;remain
      a few days with them if necessary. Make them comfortable, no matter what
      the expense. If they had means they wouldn&rsquo;t need us, but now&mdash;well,
      no difference about the why and wherefore&mdash;you just go and comfort
      and help them materially and substantially.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in such a deed as this that the true nobility of Allen Miller&rsquo;s
      character shone forth like a star of the brightest magnitude&mdash;a star
      guaranteeing forgiveness of all his blunders and stupid attempts to curb
      the impulsive and proud spirit of Roderick War-field Yet sympathy for Gail
      and her father in no way condoned their poverty to his judgment as a man
      of finance or reinstated the girl as an eligible match for the young man.
      He would have been glad of tidings of Roderick&mdash;to have him home
      again and the offensive matrimonial condition he had attached to his offer
      of an appointment in the bank finally eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no news, and meanwhile his wife had returned from her
      mission, to report that the Holdens, while sincerely grateful, had
      declined all offers of assistance. As Mrs. Miller described, it was the
      girl herself who had declared, with the light of quiet self-reliance in
      her eyes, that by working the ranch in Wyoming as she proposed to work it
      there would be ample provision for her father&rsquo;s little luxuries and
      her own simple needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Allen Miller put Gail Holden out of mind. But he had many secret
      heartaches over his rupture with Roderick, and every little stack of mail
      matter laid upon his desk was eagerly turned over in the hope that at last
      the wanderer&rsquo;s whereabouts would be disclosed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE COLLEGE WIDOW
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>TELLA RAIN
      belonged to one of the first families of Galesburg. Their beautiful home,
      an old style Southern mansion, painted white with green shutters, was just
      across from the college campus ground. It was the usual fate of seniors
      about to pass out of Knox College to be in love, avowedly or secretly,
      with this fair &ldquo;college widow.&rdquo; She was petite of form and
      face, and had a beautiful smile that radiated cheerfulness to the scores
      of college boys. There was a merry-come-on twinkle in her eyes that set
      the hearts of the young farmer lad students and the city chaps as well, in
      tumultuous riot. Beneath it all she was kind of heart, and it was this
      innate consideration for others that caused her to introduce all the new
      boys and the old ones too, as they came to college year after year, to
      Galesburg&rsquo;s fairest girls. She was ready to fit in anywhere&mdash;a
      true &ldquo;college widow&rdquo; in the broadest sense of the term. Her
      parents were wealthy and she had no greater ambition than to be a queen
      among the college boys. Those who knew her best said that she would live
      and die a spinster because of her inability to select someone from among
      the hundreds of her admirers. Others said she had had a serious affair of
      the heart when quite young. But that was several years before Roderick
      Warfield had come upon the scene and been in due course smitten by her
      charms. How badly smitten he only now fully realized when, after nearly a
      year of absence, he found himself once again tête-à-tête with her in the
      old familiar drawing-room of her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been an hour of pleasant desultory conversation, the exchange of
      reminiscences and of little sympathetic confidences, a subtly growing
      tension in the situation which she had somewhat abruptly broken by going
      to the piano and dashing off a brilliant Hungarian rhapsody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are determined to go West?&rdquo; she inquired as she
      rose to select from the cabinet another sheet of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Roderick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going far West. I am
      going after a fortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How courageous you are,&rdquo; she replied, glancing at him over
      her shoulder with merry, twinkling eyes, as if she were proud of his
      ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stella,&rdquo; said Roderick, as she returned to the piano, where
      he was now standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said she, looking up encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why; you see, Stella&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mind me telling you&mdash;well,
      Stella, if I find the lost gold mine&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you find what?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I mean,&rdquo; said Roderick in confusion, &ldquo;I mean if I
      find a fortune. Don&rsquo;t you know, if I get rich out in that western
      country&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hope and believe you will,&rdquo; broke in Stella,
      vivaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I say, if I do succeed, may I come back for you&mdash;yes,
      marry you, and will you go out there with me to live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Roderick, are you jesting now? You are just one of these
      mischievous college boys trying to touch the heart of the little college
      widow.&rdquo; She laughed gaily at him, as if full of disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; protested Roderick, &ldquo;I am sincere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella Rain looked at him a moment in admiration. He was tall and strong&mdash;a
      veritable athlete. His face was oval and yet there was a square-jawed
      effect in its moulding. His eyes were dark and luminous and frank, and
      wore a look of matureness, of determined purpose, she had never seen there
      before. Finally she asked: &ldquo;Do you know, Roderick, how old I am?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick looked at her he saw there was plaintive regret in her dark
      sincere eyes. There was no merry-come-on in them now; at last she was
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how old
      you are and I don&rsquo;t care. I only know that you appeal to me more
      than any other woman I have ever met, and all the boys like, you, and I
      love you, and I want you for my wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down here by my side,&rdquo; said Stella. &ldquo;Let me talk to
      you in great frankness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick seated himself by her side and reaching over took one of her
      hands in his. He fondled it with appreciation&mdash;it was small, delicate
      and tapering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my heart was given to a college
      boy when I was only eighteen years old. He went away to his home in an
      eastern state, and then he forgot me and married the girl he had gone to
      school with as a little boy&mdash;during the red apple period of their
      lives. It pleased his family better and perhaps it was better; and it will
      not please your family, Roderick, if you marry me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My family be hanged,&rdquo; said Roderick with emphasis. &ldquo;I
      have just had a quarrel with my uncle, Allen Miller, and I am alone in the
      world. I have no family. If you become my wife, why, we&rsquo;ll&mdash;.
      we&rsquo;ll be a family to ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella smiled sadly and said: &ldquo;You enthusiastic boy. How old are
      you, Roderick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty-four and getting older every day.&rdquo; They both
      laughed and Stella sighed and said: &ldquo;Oh, dear, how the years are
      running against us&mdash;I mean running against me. No, no,&rdquo; she
      said, half to herself, &ldquo;it never can be&mdash;it is impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Roderick, rising to his feet, and at the same
      moment she also stood before him&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s impossible? Is
      it impossible for you to love me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; said Stella, and he noticed tears in her eyes.
      &ldquo;No, Roderick,&rdquo; and she stood before him holding both his
      hands in hers&mdash;&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;listen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all attention,&rdquo; said Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you how it will all end&mdash;we will never marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I say we shall marry,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;If you
      will have me&mdash;if you love me&mdash;for I love you better than all
      else on earth.&rdquo; He started to take her in his arms and she raised
      her hand remonstratingly, and said: &ldquo;Wait! Here is what I mean,&rdquo;
      and she looked up at him helplessly. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo;&mdash;she was
      speaking slowly&mdash;&ldquo;I mean that you believe today, this hour,
      this minute that you want me for your wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; insisted Roderick, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but wait&mdash;wait until I finish. I will promise to be your
      wife, Roderick&mdash;yes, I will promise&mdash;if you come for me I will
      marry you. But, oh, Roderick,&rdquo;&mdash;and there were tears this time
      in her voice as well as in her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;You will never come back&mdash;you
      will meet others not so old as I am, for I am very, very old, and tonight
      I feel that I would give worlds and worlds if they were mine to give, were
      I young once again. Of course, in your youthful generosity you don&rsquo;t
      know what the disparagement of age means between husband and wife, when
      the husband is younger. A man may be a score of years older than a woman
      and all will be well&mdash;if they grow old together. It is God&rsquo;s
      way. But if a woman is eight or ten years older than her husband, it is
      all different. No, Roderick, don&rsquo;t take me in your arms, don&rsquo;t
      even kiss me until I bid you good-by when you start for that gold&rsquo;
      mine of yours&rdquo;&mdash;and as she said this she tried to laugh in her
      old way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to think,&rdquo; said Roderick in a half-vexed, determined
      tone, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t know my own mind&mdash;that I do not know
      my own heart. Why, do you know, Stella, I have never loved any other girl
      nor ever had even a love affair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him quickly and said: &ldquo;Roderick, that&rsquo;s just the
      trouble&mdash;you do not know&mdash;you cannot make a comparison, nor you
      won&rsquo;t know until the other girl comes along. And then, then,&rdquo;
      she said wearily, &ldquo;I shall be weighed in the balance and found
      wanting, because&mdash;oh, Roderick, I am so old, and I am so sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
      and she turned away and hid her face in her hands. &ldquo;I believe in you
      and I could love you with all my strength and soul. I am willing&mdash;listen
      Roderick,&rdquo; she put up her hands protectingly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
      impatient&mdash;I am willing to believe that you will be constant&mdash;that
      you will come back&mdash;I am willing to promise to be your wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me the happiest man in the world,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Roderick, crushing her to him with a sense of possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is one promise I am going to ask you to make,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will promise anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is this: If the other girl should come along, don&rsquo;t
      fail to follow the inclination of your heart, for I could not be your wife
      and believe that the image of another woman was kept sacredly hidden away
      in the deep recesses of your soul. Do you understand?&rdquo; There was
      something in her words&mdash;something in the way she spoke them&mdash;something
      in the thought, that struck Roderick as love itself, and it pleased him,
      because love is unselfish. Then he remembered that as yet he was penniless&mdash;it
      stung him. However, the world was before him and he must carve out a
      future and a fortune. It might take years, and in the meantime what of
      Stella Rain, who was even now deploring her many years? She would be
      getting older, and her chances, perhaps, for finding a home and settling
      down with a husband would be less and less.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he knew there was no such thought of selfishness on her part&mdash;her
      very unselfishness appealed to him strongly and added a touch of chivalry
      to his determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella Rain sank into a cushioned chair and rested her chin upon one hand
      while, reaching to the piano keys with the other, she thrummed them
      softly. Roderick walked back and forth slowly before her in deep
      meditation. At last he paused and said: &ldquo;I love you, I will prove I
      am worthy. There is no time to lose. The hour grows late. I have but an
      hour to reach my hotel, get my luggage and go to the depot I am going West
      tonight I will come for you within one year, provided I make my fortune;
      and I firmly believe in my destiny. If not&mdash;if I do not come&mdash;I
      will release you from your betrothal, if it is your wish that I do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella Rain laughed more naturally, and the old &ldquo;come-on&rdquo;
      twinkling was in her eyes again as she said: &ldquo;Roderick, I don&rsquo;t
      want to be released, because I love you very, very much. It is not that&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      because&mdash;well, no difference&mdash;if you come, Roderick,&rdquo; and
      she raised her hand to him from the piano&mdash;&ldquo;if you come, and
      still want me to be your wife, I will go with you and live in the
      mountains or the remotest corner of the earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand in both his own and kissed it tenderly. &ldquo;Very well,
      Stella,&mdash;you make it plain to me. But you shall see&mdash;you shall
      see,&rdquo; and he looked squarely into her beautiful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, rising to her feet, &ldquo;we shall see,
      Roderick, we shall see. And do you know,&rdquo; the twinkling was now gone
      from her eyes once more and she became serious again&mdash;&ldquo;do you
      know, Roderick, it is the dearest hope of my life that you will come? But
      I shall love you just as much as I do now, Roderick, if for any cause&mdash;for
      whatever reason&mdash;you do not come. Do you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed Roderick, &ldquo;we are betrothed, are we
      not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and said, smiling half sadly: &ldquo;Surely, Roderick,
      we are betrothed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his big strong hands up to her cheeks, lifted her face to his and
      kissed her reverently. Then with a hasty good-by he turned and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick hurried across the old campus he felt the elation of a
      gladiator. Of course, he would win in life&rsquo;s battle, and would
      return for Stella Rain, the dearest girl in all the world. The stars were
      twinkling bright, the moon in the heavens was in the last quarter&mdash;bright
      moon and stars, fit companions for him in his all-conquering spirit of
      optimism.

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;WESTWARD HO!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S the train
      rumbled along carrying Roderick back to Burlington, he was lost in reverie
      and exultation. He was making plans for a mighty future, into which now a
      romance of love was interwoven as well as the romance of a mysterious gold
      mine awaiting rediscovery in some hidden valley among rugged mountains.
      Yes; he would lose no further time in starting out for Wyoming. The
      winning of the one treasure meant the winning of the other&mdash;the
      making of both his own. As he dreamed of wealth unbounded, there was
      always singing in his heart the name of Stella Rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he was aboard a westbound train, booked for Rawlins, Wyoming,
      where, as his father&rsquo;s letter had directed, he was likely to find
      the old frontiersman, Jim Rankin; perhaps also the other &ldquo;cronies&rdquo;
      referred to by name, Tom Sun and Boney Earnest At Omaha a young westerner
      boarded the train, and took a seat in the Pullman car opposite to
      Roderick. In easy western style the two fell into conversation, and
      Roderick soon learned that the newcomer&rsquo;s name was Grant Jones, that
      he was a newspaper man by calling and resided in Dillon, Wyoming, right in
      the midst of the rich copper mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are just over the mountain,&rdquo; explained Jones, &ldquo;from
      the town of Encampment, where the big smelter is located.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train sped along and they became better acquainted, Grant Jones
      pointed out to Roderick a dignified gentleman with glasses and a gray
      mustache occupying a seat well to the front of the car, and told him that
      this particular individual was no other than the &ldquo;Boss of Montana&rdquo;&mdash;Senator
      &ldquo;Fence Everything&rdquo; Greed. Jones laughed heartily at the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, he is the U. S. Senator from Montana,&rdquo; continued
      Jones, soberly, &ldquo;and his name is F. E. Greed. His enemies out in
      Montana will be highly pleased at the new name I have given him&mdash;&rsquo;Fence
      Everything,&rsquo; because he has fenced in over 150,000 acres of
      Government land, it is claimed, and run the actual home-settlers out of
      his fenced enclosures while his immense herds of cattle trampled under
      foot and ate up the poor evicted people&rsquo;s crops. Oh, he&rsquo;s some
      &lsquo;boss,&rsquo; all right, all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s lawlessness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones turned and looked at Roderick and said: &ldquo;The rich are
      never lawless, especially United States Senators&mdash;not out in Montana.
      Why, bless your heart, they say the superintendent of his ranch is on the
      payroll down at Washington at $1800 a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likewise the superintendent of the electric lighting plant which
      Senator Greed owns, as well as the superintendent of his big general
      store, are said to be on the government payroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has also been charged that his son was on the public payroll
      while at college. Oh, no, it is not lawless; it is just a dignified form
      of graft. Of course,&rdquo; Jones went on with arched eyebrows, &ldquo;I
      remember one case where a homesteader shot one of the Senator&rsquo;s
      fatted cattle&mdash;fine stock, blooded, you know. It was perhaps worth
      $100. Of course the man was arrested, had a &lsquo;fair trial&rsquo; and
      is now doing time in the penitentiary. In the meantime, his wife and
      little children have been sent back East to her people. You see,&rdquo;
      said Jones, smiling, &ldquo;this small rancher, both poor in purse and
      without influence, was foolish enough to lose his temper because five or
      six hundred head of Senator Greed&rsquo;s cattle were driven by his
      cowboys over the rancher&rsquo;s land and the cattle incidentally, as they
      went along, ate up his crops. Little thing to get angry about, wasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo; and Jones laughed sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t the state conventions pass resolutions denouncing
      their U. S. Senator for such cold-blooded tyrannizing methods?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the state of Montana,&rdquo; replied Grant Jones, &ldquo;should
      ever hold a state convention of its representative people&mdash;the bone
      and sinew of its sovereign citizens, why, they would not only retire
      Senator Greed to private life, but they would consign him to the warmer
      regions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;I supposed that
      every state held conventions&mdash;delegates you know, from each county.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They think they do,&rdquo; said Jones, winking one eye, &ldquo;but
      they are only ratification meetings. The &lsquo;Boss,&rsquo;&rdquo;he
      continued, nodding his head towards Senator Greed, &ldquo;has his faithful
      lieutenants in each precinct of every county. His henchmen select the
      alleged delegates and when they all get together in a so-called state
      convention they are by pre-arrangement program men. The slate is fixed up
      by the &lsquo;Boss&rsquo; and is duly ratified without a hitch. Therefore
      instead of being a convention representing the people it is a great big
      farce&mdash;a ratification picnic where &lsquo;plums&rsquo; are dealt out
      and the ears of any who become fractious duly cuffed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Grand Island in the afternoon, during a stop while engines were
      changed, Roderick left the train and stretched his legs by walking up and
      down the depot platform. Here he saw Grant Jones in a new rôle.
      Notwithstanding Jones was in rough western garb&mdash;khaki Norfolk coat,
      trousers to match, and leather leggings&mdash;yet he was the center of
      attraction for a bevy of young ladies. Two of these in particular were
      remarkable for their beauty; both had the same burnished golden hair and
      large brown eyes; they were almost identical in height and figure, petite
      and graceful, dressed alike, so that anyone at a first glance would have
      recognized them to be not only sisters but doubtless twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train was about ready to start, these two girls bade adieu to
      their numerous friends and permitted Grant Jones with all the gallantry of
      a Beau Brummel to assist them onto the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Grant Jones took great pains to assure Roderick that it was a
      pleasure to introduce him to the Misses Barbara and Dorothy Shields&mdash;&ldquo;Two
      of our&rsquo; mountain wild flowers,&rdquo; Grant said, laughing
      pleasantly, &ldquo;who reside with their people way over south in the
      Wyoming hills, not far from Encampment, on one of the biggest cattle
      ranges in the state.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick, already captivated by the whole-souled, frank manner of Grant
      Jones, now found himself much interested in the beautiful twin sisters as
      well. Hour followed hour in bright and sprightly conversation, and soon
      the tenderfoot who had been inclined to condole with himself as a lonely
      stranger among strangers was feeling quite at home in the great western
      world of hospitable welcome and good comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an early hour next morning Grant Jones, the Shields girls and a dozen
      other people left the train at the little town of Walcott. They extended
      hearty invitations for Roderick to come over to southern Wyoming to see
      the country, its great mines and the big smelter. &ldquo;If you pay us a
      visit,&rdquo; said Grant Jones, laughing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise you a
      fine big personal in the <i>Dillon Doublejack</i>, of which mighty organ
      of public opinion I have the honor to be editor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick, with a bow of due reverence for his editorial majesty and a
      bright smile for the sisters, promised that he likely would make the trip
      before very long. Then he swung himself onto the already moving train and
      continued his westward journey to Rawlins.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;RODERICK MEETS JIM RANKIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was seven o&rsquo;clock
      the same morning when Roderick left the train at Rawlins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raw, cold wind was blowing a terrific gale, the streets were deserted
      save for a few half drunken stragglers who had been making a night of it,
      going the rounds of saloons and gambling dens.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright-faced lad took charge of the mail bags, threw them into a push
      cart and started rumbling away up the street. Warfield followed and coming
      up with him inquired for a hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right over there is the Ferris House,&rdquo; said the young fellow,
      nodding his head in the direction indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick approached the hotel he met a grizzled keen-eyed frontiersman
      who saluted him with a friendly &ldquo;Hello, partner, you be a stranger
      in these yere parts, I&rsquo;m assoomin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I just arrived on this morning&rsquo;s train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, my handle is Jim Rankin. Been prospectin&rsquo; the range
      hereabouts nigh thirty years; uster be sheriff of this yere county when
      people wuz hostile a plenty&mdash;have the best livery stable today in
      Wyomin&rsquo;, and always glad to see strangers loiterin&rsquo; &lsquo;round
      and help &lsquo;em to git their bearin&rsquo;s if I can be of service&mdash;you
      bet I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus early had Roderick encountered his father&rsquo;s old friend. He was
      delighted, but for the present kept his own counsel. A more fitting time
      and place must be found to tell the reason of his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he contented himself with saying as he accepted
      the frontiersman&rsquo;s hand of welcome; &ldquo;glad to meet you, Mr.
      Rankin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, boy,&rdquo; shouted the latter to an attache of the hotel,
      &ldquo;take care of this yere baggage; it belongs to this yere gentleman,
      a dangnation good friend uv mine. He&rsquo;ll be back soon fur breakfast.
      Come on, stranger, let&rsquo;s go over to Wren&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m as dry
      as a fish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick smiled and turning about, accompanied his new discovery down the
      street to Wren&rsquo;s. As they walked along Rankin said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      my barn and here&rsquo;s the alley. We&rsquo;ll turn in here and get into
      Wren&rsquo;s by the back door. I never pester the front door. Lots uv
      fellers git a heap careless with their artillery on front steps that are
      docile &lsquo;nuff inside.&rdquo; As they passed through a back gate, Jim
      Rankin, the typical old-time westerner, pushed his hat well back on his
      head, fished out of his pocket a pouch of &ldquo;fine cut&rdquo; tobacco,
      and stowing away a large wad in his mouth began masticating rapidly, like
      an automobile on the low gear. Between vigorous &ldquo;chaws&rdquo; he
      observed that the sun would be up in a &ldquo;minute&rdquo; and then the
      wind would go down. &ldquo;Strange but true as gospel,&rdquo; he chuckled&mdash;perhaps
      at his superior knowledge of the West&mdash;&ldquo;when the sun comes up
      the wind goes down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He expectorated a huge pit-tew of tobacco juice at an old ash barrel,
      wiped his iron gray mustache with the back of his hand, pushed open the
      back door of the saloon and invited Roderick to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire was burning briskly in a round sheet iron stove, and a half dozen
      wooden-backed chairs were distributed about a round-topped table covered
      with a green cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rankin touched a press button, and when a white-aproned waiter responded
      and stood with a silent look of inquiry on his face the frontiersman
      cleared his throat and said: &ldquo;A dry Martini fur me; what pizen do
      you nominate, partner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same,&rdquo; was Roderick&rsquo;s rather abbreviated reply as he
      took in the surroundings with a furtive glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the waiter retired to fill the orders, Roderick&rsquo;s new
      found friend pulled a coal scuttle close to his chair to serve as a
      receptacle for his tobacco expectorations, and began: &ldquo;You see,
      speakin&rsquo; wide open like, I know all these yere fellers&mdash;know
      &lsquo;em like a book. Out at the bar in front is a lot uv booze-fightin&rsquo;
      sheep herders makin&rsquo; things gay and genial, mixin&rsquo; up with a
      lot uv discharged railroad men. Been makin&rsquo; some big shipments uv
      sheep east, lately, and when they get tumultuous like with a whole night&rsquo;s
      jag of red liquor under their belt, they forgit about the true artickle uv
      manhood and I cut &lsquo;em out. Hope they&rsquo;ll get away afore the
      cattle men come in from over north, otherwise there&rsquo;ll be plenty uv
      ugly shootin&rsquo;. Last year we made seven new graves back there,&rdquo;
      and he jerked his thumb over his shoulder, &ldquo;seven graves as a result
      uv a lot uv sheep herders and cow punchers tryin&rsquo; to do the perlite
      thing here at Wren&rsquo;s parlors the same night They got to shootin&rsquo;
      in a onrestrained fashion and a heap careless. You bet if I wuz sheriff uv
      this yere county agin I&rsquo;d see to it that law and order had the long
      end uv the stick&mdash;though I must allow they did git hostile and hang
      Big Nose George when I wuz in office,&rdquo; he added after a pause. Then
      he chuckled quietly to himself, for the moment lost in retrospection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the waiter brought in the drinks and when he retired Rankin got
      up very cautiously, tried the door to see if it was tightly shut. Coming
      back to the table and seating himself he lifted his glass, but before
      drinking said: &ldquo;Say, pard, I don&rsquo;t want to be too presumin&rsquo;,
      but what&rsquo;s your handle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick felt that the proper moment had arrived, and went straight to his
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Roderick Warfield. I am the son of John Warfield with
      whom I believe you had some acquaintance a number of years ago. My father
      is dead, as you doubtless may have heard&mdash;died some fourteen years
      since. He left a letter for me which only recently came into my
      possession, and in the letter he spoke of three men&mdash;Jim Rankin, Tom
      Sun and Boney Earnest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick was speaking, the frontiersman reverently returned his
      cocktail to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geewhillikins!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you the son uv John
      Warfield! Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered. This just nachurly gits on my
      wind. Shake, young man.&rdquo; And Jim Rankin gave Roderick&rsquo;s hand
      the clinch of a vise; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mighty sight more than delighted
      to see you, and you can count on my advice and help, every day in the week
      and Sundays thrown in. As you&rsquo;re a stranger in these parts, I&rsquo;m
      assoomin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll need it a plenty, you bet. Gee, but I&rsquo;m
      as glad to see you as I&rsquo;d be to see a brother. Let&rsquo;s drink to
      the memory uv your good father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He again lifted his cocktail and Roderick joined him by picking up a side
      glass of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Rankin, &ldquo;not drinkin&rsquo; yer cocktail?
      What&rsquo;s squirmin&rsquo; in yer vitals?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drink nothing stronger than water,&rdquo; replied Roderick,
      looking his father&rsquo;s old friend squarely in the eyes. Thus early in
      their association he was glad to settle this issue once and for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake again,&rdquo; said Rankin, after tossing off his drink at a
      single swallow and setting down his empty glass, &ldquo;you sure &lsquo;nuff
      are the son uv John Warfield. Wuz with him off and on fur many a year and
      he never drank spirits under no circumstances. You bet I wuz just nachurly
      so dangnation flabbergasted at meetin&rsquo; yer I got plumb locoed and
      sure did fergit. Boney and Tom and me often speak uv him to this day, and
      they&rsquo;ll be dangnation glad to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re all three still in the ring?&rdquo; queried
      Roderick with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet yer life,&rdquo; replied Rankin sturdily. &ldquo;Why, Tom Sun
      and Boney Earnest and me have been chums fur nigh on to thirty years. They&rsquo;re
      the best scouts that ever hunted in the hills. They&rsquo;re the chaps who
      put up my name at the convenshun, got me nominated and then elected me
      sheriff of this yere county over twenty-five years ago. Gosh but I&rsquo;m
      certainly glad to see yer and that&rsquo;s my attitood.&rdquo; He smiled
      broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Warfield,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what yer out here fur?
      But first, hold on a minute afore yer prognosticate yer answer. Just shove
      that &lsquo;tother cocktail over this way&mdash;dangnation afeerd you&rsquo;ll
      spill it; no use letting it go to waste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; replied Roderick, smiling and pushing the
      cocktail across to Jim Rankin, &ldquo;to grow up with the country. A young
      fellow when he gets through college days has got to get out and do
      something, and some way I&rsquo;ve drifted out to Wyoming to try and make
      a start. I have lots of good health, but precious little money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Rankin drank the remaining cocktail, pulled his chair a little closer
      to Roderick&rsquo;s and spoke in a stage whisper: &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m
      assoomin&rsquo;, what yer father was huntin&rsquo; fur when he got hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick flushed slightly and remained silent for a moment. Was it
      possible that his father&rsquo;s old friend, Jim Rankin, knew of the lost
      mine? Finally he replied: &ldquo;Well, yes, I know in a general way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak too dangnation loud,&rdquo; enjoined Rankin.
      &ldquo;Come on and we&rsquo;ll hike out uv this and go into one uv the
      back stalls uv my livery stable. This&rsquo;s no place to talk about sich
      things&mdash;even walls have ears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went out again by the back door the morning sun was looking at
      them from the rim of the eastern hills. Side by side and in silence they
      walked along the alley to the street, then turned and went into a big
      barn-like building bearing a sign-board inscribed: &ldquo;Rankin&rsquo;s
      Livery, Feed and Sale Stable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there was not a soul in sight, Rankin led his new acquaintance
      far back to the rear of the building. As they passed, a dozen or more
      horses whinnied, impatient for their morning feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cautiously and without a word being spoken they went into an empty stall
      in a far corner, and there in a deep whisper, Rankin said: &ldquo;I know
      the hull shootin&rsquo; match about that &lsquo;ere lost gold mine, but
      Tom and Boney don&rsquo;t&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been peevish, good and
      plenty, two or three different times thinkin&rsquo; I know&rsquo;d suthin&rsquo;
      they didn&rsquo;t. Not a blamed thing does anybody know but me, you bet I
      went with your father on three different trips, but we didn&rsquo;t quite
      locate the place. I believe it&rsquo;s on Jack Creek or Cow Creek&mdash;maybe
      furder over&mdash;don&rsquo;t know which, somewhere this side or t&rsquo;other
      side of Encampment River. You kin bet big money I kin help a heap&mdash;a
      mighty lot But say nothin&rsquo; to nobody&mdash;specially to these
      soopercilious high-steppin&rsquo; chaps &lsquo;round here&mdash;not a
      dangnation word&mdash;keep it mum. This is a razzle-dazzle just &lsquo;tween
      you an&rsquo; me, young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed, and the two stood there looking at each other.
      Presently Roderick said: &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll go over to the hotel
      and get some breakfast; this western air gives one a ravenous appetite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they both laughed a little as if anxious to relieve an embarrassing
      situation, and went out to the street together. Jim knew in his heart he
      had been outclassed; he had shown his whole hand, the other not one single
      card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Rankin finally said, as if an invitation had been
      extended to him. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll jist loiter along with yer
      over to&rsquo;rd the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At another time,&rdquo; observed Roderick, &ldquo;we will talk
      further about my father&rsquo;s errand into this western country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dope that sure &lsquo;nuff suits me, Mr.
      War-field,&rdquo; replied Rankin. &ldquo;Whatever you say goes. Yer can
      unbosom yerself to me any time to the limit. I&rsquo;ve got a dozen good
      mining deals to talk to you about; they&rsquo;re dandies&mdash;a fortune
      in every one uv &lsquo;em&mdash;&rsquo;a bird in every shell,&rsquo; I
      might say,&rdquo; and Rankin laughed heartily at his happy comparison.
      &ldquo;Remember one thing, Warfield,&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped and took hold
      of the lapel of Roderick&rsquo;s coat, and again spoke in a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;this
      yere town is full uv &lsquo;hot air&rsquo; merchants. Don&rsquo;t have
      nuthin&rsquo; to do with &lsquo;em&mdash;stand pat with me and I&rsquo;ll
      see by the great horn spoon the worst you get will be the best uv
      everythin&rsquo; we tackle. Well, so long until after breakfast; I&rsquo;ll
      see you later.&rdquo; And with this Rankin turned and walked briskly back
      to his stables, whistling a melody from the &ldquo;Irish Washerwoman&rdquo;
      as he went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at his stables he lighted a fire in a drumshaped stove, threw his
      cud of tobacco away and said: &ldquo;Hell, I wish this young Warfield had
      money. I&rsquo;ve got a copper prospect within three mile uv this here
      town that&rsquo;ll knock the spots out uv the Ferris-Haggerty mine all
      holler. Geewhillikins, it&rsquo;ll jist nachur-ally make all the best
      mines in Wyomin&rsquo; look like small-sized Shetland ponies at a Perch&rsquo;ron
      draft horse show. You bet that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After feeding his horses he came back to the livery barn office, now quite
      warm and comfortable, pulled up an old broken backed chair, sat down and
      lit his pipe. After a few puffs he muttered half aloud: &ldquo;Expect I&rsquo;m
      the only man in Wyomin&rsquo; who remembers all the early hist&rsquo;ry
      and traditions about that cussed lost mine. I&rsquo;ve hunted the hills
      high and low, north, south, east and west, and dang my buttons if I can
      imagine where them blamed nuggets came from. And my failure used to make
      me at times a plenty hostile and peevish. John Warfield brought three of
      &lsquo;em out with him on his last trip. He gave Tom one, Boney one and me
      one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrusting his hand into his pocket Rankin produced a native nugget of
      gold, worn smooth and shiny, and looked at it long in silent meditation.
      It was a fine specimen of almost pure gold, and was worth perhaps five and
      twenty dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the old frontiersman brought his fist down with a startling
      thump on his knee and said aloud: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be blankety-blanked if
      I don&rsquo;t believe in that dangnation fairy story yet. You bet I do,
      and I&rsquo;ll help John Warfield&rsquo;s boy find it, by the great horn
      spoon I will, if it takes every horse in the stable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Rankin relit his pipe, smoked vigorously and thought. The power of
      silence was strong upon him. The restless spirit of the fortune hunter was
      again surging in his blood and awaking slumbering half-forgotten hopes&mdash;yes,
      tugging at his heart-strings and calling to him to forsake all else and
      flee to the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rankin was a character, a representative of the advance band of sturdy
      trail-blazers of the West&mdash;tender-hearted as a child, generous to a
      fault, ready to divide his last crust with a friend, yet quick to resent
      an injury, and stubborn as a bullock when roused to self-defense. There
      was nothing cunning about him, nothing of greed and avarice, no spirit of
      envy for the possession of things for the things&rsquo; sake. But for him
      there was real joy in the mad pursuit of things unattainable&mdash;a joy
      that enthralled and enthused him with the fervor of eternal youth. His was
      the simple life of the hills, loving his few chums and turning his back on
      all whom he disliked or mistrusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other men and greater men there may be, but it was men of Jim Rankin&rsquo;s
      type that could build, and did build, monuments among the wild western
      waste of heat-blistered plains and gaunt rock-ribbed mountains, men who
      braved the wilderness and there laid the first foundation stones of a
      splendid civilization&mdash;splendid, yet even now only in its first
      beginnings, a civilization that means happy homes and smiling fields where
      before all was barrenness and desolation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;GETTING ACQUAINTED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ODERICK spent a
      few days in Rawlins, improving his acquaintance with Jim Rankin and making
      a general survey of the situation. The ex-sheriff proved to be a veritable
      repository of local information, and Roderick soon knew a little about
      everyone and everything in the district. He learned that Tom Sun, one of
      his father&rsquo;s old associates, had from small beginnings come to be
      the largest sheep owner in the state; he was rich and prosperous. With
      Boney Earnest, however, the other friend mentioned in the letter, the case
      was different. Boney had stuck for years to prospecting and desultory
      mining without achieving any substantial success, but had eventually
      become a blast furnace man in the big smelting plant at Encampment. There
      he had worked his way up to a foreman&rsquo;s position, and with his
      practical knowledge of all the ores in the region was the real brains of
      the establishment, as Jim Rankin forcibly declared. He had a large family
      which absorbed all his earnings and always kept him on the ragged edge of
      necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rankin himself was not too well fixed&mdash;just making a more or less
      precarious subsistence out of his stage line and livery stable business.
      But he had several big mining deals in hand or at least in prospect, one
      or other of which was &ldquo;dead sure to turn up trumps some day.&rdquo;
      The &ldquo;some day&rdquo; appeared to be indefinitely postponed, but
      meanwhile Jim had the happiness of living in the genial sunshiny
      atmosphere of hope. And the coming of Roderick had changed this mellowed
      sunshine into positive radiance, rekindling all the old fires of
      enthusiasm in the heart of the old-time prospector. With Roderick the
      first surge of eager impetuosity had now settled down into quiet
      determination. But old Jim Rankin&rsquo;s blood was at fever-heat in his
      eagerness to find the hidden valley. When alone with Roderick he could
      talk of nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick, however, had shrewdly and cautiously summed up the measure of
      his usefulness. Jim Rankin had not the necessary capital to finance a
      systematic search among the mountain fastnesses where nature so jealously
      guarded her secret. Nor could he leave his horses and his livery business
      for any long period, however glibly he might talk about &ldquo;going out
      and finding the blamed place.&rdquo; As for any precise knowledge of where
      the quest should be commenced, he had none. He had shared in the frequent
      attempts and failures of Roderick&rsquo;s father, and after a lapse of
      some fifteen or sixteen years had even a slimmer chance now than then of
      hitting the spot. So, all things duly considered, Roderick had adhered to
      his original resolution of playing a lone hand. Not even to Rankin did he
      show his father&rsquo;s letter and map; their relations were simply an
      understanding that the old frontiersman would help Roderick out to the
      best of his power whenever opportunity offered and in all possible ways,
      and that for services rendered there would be liberal recompense should
      golden dreams come to be realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason weighed with Roderick in holding to a policy of reticence.
      Despite Jim&rsquo;s own frequent cautions to &ldquo;keep mum&mdash;say
      nothing to nobody,&rdquo; he himself was not the best hand at keeping a
      secret, especially after a few cocktails had lubricated his natural
      loquacity. At such moments, under the mildly stimulating influence, Jim
      dearly loved to hint at mysterious knowledge locked up in his breast. And
      in a mining camp vague hints are liable to become finger posts and
      signboards&mdash;the very rocks and trees seem to be possessed of ears. So
      young Warfield was at least erring on the safe side in keeping his own
      counsel and giving no unnecessary confidences anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to be gained by remaining longer at Rawlins. Roderick&rsquo;s
      slender finances rendered it imperative that he should find work of some
      kind&mdash;work that would enable him to save a sufficient stake for the
      prospecting venture, or give him the chance to search out the proper
      moneyed partner who would be ready to share in the undertaking. And since
      he had to work it would be well that his work should, if possible, be on
      the range, where while earning his maintenance and husbanding his
      resources, he could at the same time be spying out the land and gaining
      invaluable experience. So he had on several occasions discussed with Jim
      Rankin the chances of finding a temporary job on one of the big cattle
      ranches, and after one of these conversations had come his decision to
      move at once from Rawlins. His first &ldquo;voyage of discovery&rdquo;
      would be to Encampment, the busy smelter town. He remembered the cordial
      invitation extended to him by Grant Jones, the newspaper man, and felt
      sure he would run across him there. From the first he had felt strongly
      drawn to this buoyant young spirit of the West, and mingled with his
      desire for such comradeship was just a little longing, maybe, to glimpse
      again the fair smiling faces of the twin sisters&mdash;&ldquo;mountain
      wild flowers&rdquo; as Grant Jones had so happily described Barbara and
      Dorothy Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one fine morning Roderick found himself seated beside Jim Rankin on the
      driver&rsquo;s seat of an old-fashioned Concord stage coach. With a crack
      of Jim&rsquo;s whip, the six frisky horses, as was their wont at the
      beginning of a journey, started off at a gallop down the street. Five or
      six passengers were stowed away in the coach. But these were nothing to
      Jim Rankin and Roderick Warfield. They could converse on their own affairs
      during the long day&rsquo;s drive. The old frontiersman was, as usual, in
      talkative mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gunnies,&rdquo; he exclaimed sotto-voce, as they wheeled along,
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find that pesky lost gold mine, don&rsquo;t you forget
      it. I know pretty dangnation near its location now. You bet I do and I&rsquo;ll
      unbosom myself and take you to it&mdash;jist you and me. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;
      a heap these yere days, you bet I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Along in the afternoon they crossed over Jack Creek, an important stream
      of water flowing from the west into the North Platte River. Jim Rankin
      stopped the stage coach and pointed out to our hero the &ldquo;deadline&rdquo;
      between the cattle and sheep range. &ldquo;All this yere territory,&rdquo;
      said Jim, &ldquo;lying north uv Jack Creek is nachure&rsquo;s sheep
      pasture and all lyin&rsquo; south uv Jack is cattle range.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well known,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;where them blamed
      pesky sheep feed and graze, by gunnies, vegetation don&rsquo;t grow agin
      successful for several years. The sheep not only nachurlly eat the grass
      down to its roots, but their sharp hoofs cut the earth into fine pulp
      fields uv dust. Jack Creek is the dividin&rsquo; line&mdash;the &lsquo;dead
      line.&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by the &lsquo;dead line&rsquo;.&rdquo; asked
      Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;dead line,&rsquo;&rdquo;replied old Jim as he clucked
      to his horses and swung his long whip at the off-leader&mdash;&ldquo;the
      &lsquo;dead line&rsquo; is where by the great horn spoon the sheep can&rsquo;t
      go any furder south and the cattle darsn&rsquo;t come any furder north, or
      when they do, Hell&rsquo;s a-pop-pin.&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happens?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happens?&rdquo; repeated the frontiersman as he expectorated a
      huge pit-tew of tobacco juice at a cactus that stood near the roadway.
      &ldquo;Why, by gunnies, hundreds uv ondefensible sheep have been actooally
      clubbed to death in a single night by raidin&rsquo; cowboys and the
      sheep-herders shot to death while sleepin&rsquo; in their camp wagons: and
      their cookin&rsquo; outfit, which is usually in one end uv the wagon, as
      well as the camp wagons, burned to conceal evidence of these dastardly
      murders. Oh, they sure do make things gay and genial like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Astonishing! The cowboys must be a pretty wicked lot,&rdquo;
      interrogated Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s about six uv one and half a dozen uv the other.
      You see these pesky sheep herders and the cowboys are all torn off the
      same piece uv cloth. Many a range rider has been picked from his hoss by
      these sheep men hidden away in these here rocky cliffs which overlook the
      valley. They sure &lsquo;nuff get tumultuous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about the law?&rdquo; inquired Roderick. &ldquo;Does it
      afford no protection?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim laughed derisively, pushed his hat far back and replied: &ldquo;Everybody
      that does any killin&rsquo; in these here parts sure does it in
      self-defense.&rdquo; He chuckled at his superior knowledge of the West.
      &ldquo;Leastways, that&rsquo;s what the evidence brings out afore the
      courts. However, Tom Sun says the fussin&rsquo; is about over with. Last
      year more&rsquo;n twenty cattle men were sentenced to the pen&rsquo;tentiary
      up in the Big Horn country. Sort uv an offset fur about a score uv sheep
      men that&rsquo;s been killed by the cow punchers while tendin&rsquo; their
      flocks on the range. You bet they&rsquo;ve been mixin&rsquo; things up
      with artil&rsquo;ry a heap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I clearly perceive,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;that your
      sympathies are with the cattle men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Rankin turned quickly and with his piercing black eyes glared at
      Roderick as if he would rebuke him for his presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, don&rsquo;t be assoomin&rsquo;. I ain&rsquo;t got no
      sympathy fur neither one uv &lsquo;em. I don&rsquo;t believe in murder and
      I don&rsquo;t believe very much in the pen&rsquo;tentiary. &lsquo;Course
      when I was sheriff, I had to do some shootin&rsquo; but my shootin&rsquo;
      wuz all within the law. No, I don&rsquo;t care a cuss one way or &lsquo;tother.
      There are lots uv good fellers ridin&rsquo; range. Expect yer will be
      ridin&rsquo; before long. Think I can help yer get a job on the Shields
      ranch; if I can&rsquo;t Grant Jones can. And ther&rsquo;s lots uv mighty
      good sheep-herders too. My old pal, Tom Sun, is the biggest sheep-man in
      this whole dang-nation country and he&rsquo;s square, he is. So you see I
      ain&rsquo;t got no preference, &lsquo;tho&rsquo; I do say the hull kit and
      bilin&rsquo; uv &lsquo;em could be improved. Yes, I&rsquo;m nootral. Put
      that in yer pipe and smoke it, fur it goes dangnation long ways in this
      man&rsquo;s country to be nootral, and don&rsquo;t git to furgit&rsquo;n
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when they neared the little town of
      Encampment. Old Jim Rankin began to cluck to his horses and swing his whip
      gently and finally more pronouncedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is the invariable habit of stage drivers at the point of departure
      to start off their horses in a full swinging gallop, it is an equally
      inviolable rule, when they approach the point of arrival, that they come
      in with a whoop and a hooray. These laws are just as immutable as ringing
      the bell or blowing the locomotive whistle when leaving or nearing a
      station. So when Jim Rankin cracked his whip, all six horses leaned
      forward in their collars, wheeled up the main street in a swinging gallop,
      and stopped abruptly in front of the little hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick climbed down from the driver&rsquo;s seat he was greeted with
      a hearty &ldquo;Hello, Warfield, welcome to our city.&rdquo; The speaker
      was none other than Grant Jones himself, for his newspaper instincts
      always brought him, when in town, to meet the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men shook hands with all the cordiality of old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you cannot get a room here at the hotel, you can bunk with me,&rdquo;
      continued Grant. &ldquo;I have a little shack down towards the smelter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick laughed and said: &ldquo;Suppose, then, we don&rsquo;t look for a
      room. I&rsquo;ll be mighty pleased to carry my baggage to your shack now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s a go,&rdquo; said Grant; and together they
      started down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones&rsquo; bachelor home consisted of a single room&mdash;a
      hastily improvised shack, as he had correctly called it, that had cost no
      very large sum to build. It was decorated with many trophies of college
      life and of the chase. Various college pennants were on the walls,
      innumerable pipes, some rusty antiquated firearms, besides a brace of
      pistols which Jim Rankin had given to Grant, supposed to be the identical
      flint-locks carried by Big Nose George, a desperado of the early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Grant as he welcomed his guest, &ldquo;this
      is my Encampment residence. I have another shack over at Dillon where I
      edit my paper, the <i>Dillon Doublejack</i>. I spend part of my time in
      one place and part in the other. My business is in Dillon but social
      attractions&mdash;Dorothy Shields, you may have already guessed&mdash;are
      over this way.&rdquo; And he blushed red as he laughingly made the
      confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And talking of the Shields, by the way,&rdquo; resumed Grant.
      &ldquo;I want to tell you I took the liberty of mentioning your name to
      the old man. He is badly in need of some more hands on the ranch&mdash;young
      fellows who can ride and are reliable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was all alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very thing I&rsquo;m looking for,&rdquo; he said eagerly.
      &ldquo;Would he give me a place, do you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain of it. In fact I promised to bring you over to
      the ranch as soon as you turned up at Encampment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty kind of you, old fellow,&rdquo; remarked Roderick,
      gratefully and with growing familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can take that bed over there,&rdquo; said the host.
      &ldquo;This one is mine. You&rsquo;ll excuse the humble stretchers, I
      know. Then after you have opened your grip and made yourself a little at
      home, we&rsquo;ll take a stroll. I fancy that a good big porterhouse won&rsquo;t
      come amiss after your long day&rsquo;s drive. We&rsquo;ve got some pretty
      good restaurants in the town. I suppose you&rsquo;ve already discovered
      that a properly cooked juicy Wyoming steak is hard to beat, eh, you
      pampered New Yorker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick laughed as he threw open his valise and arranged his brushes and
      other toilet appurtenances on the small table that stood at the head of
      the narrow iron stretcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, when night had fallen, the young men went out into the
      main street to dine and look over the town. It was right at the edge of
      the valley with mountains rising in a semi-circle to south and west, a
      typical mountain settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see everything is wide open,&rdquo; said Grant, as he escorted
      Roderick along the streets, arm linked in arm. For they had just
      discovered that they belonged to the same college fraternity&mdash;Kappa
      Gamma Delta, so the bonds of friendship had been drawn tighter still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a great town here,&rdquo; observed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have about 1200 to 1500 people and 18 saloons!&rdquo; laughed
      the other. &ldquo;And every saloon has a gambling lay-out&mdash;anything
      from roulette to stud-poker. Over yonder is Brig Young&rsquo;s place. Here
      is Southpaw&rsquo;s Bazaar. The Red Dog is a little farther along; the
      Golden Eagle is one of the largest gambling houses in the town. We&rsquo;ll
      have our supper first, and then I&rsquo;ll take you over to Brig Young&rsquo;s
      and introduce you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they turned across the street they met a man coming toward them. He was
      straight and tall, rather handsome, but a gray mustache made him seem
      older than his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, here is Mr. Grady. Mr. Grady, I want to introduce you to a
      newcomer. This is Mr. Roderick Warfield.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to meet you, Mr. Warfield,&rdquo; said Grady in a smooth voice
      and with an oleaginous smile. To Roderick the face seemed a sinister one;
      instinctively he felt a dislike for the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your town is quite up-to-date, with all its brilliant electric
      lights,&rdquo; he observed with a polite effort at conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Grady, &ldquo;but it is the monthly pay roll of
      my big smelting company that supports the whole place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pomposity in the remark and the look that accompanied it which
      added to Roderick&rsquo;s feelings of repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; interposed Grant Jones, in a
      laughing way. &ldquo;We have about five hundred prospectors up in the
      hills who may not yet be producers, but their monthly expenditures run up
      into pretty big figures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, that amounts to something; but think of my pay roll,&rdquo;
      replied Grady, boastingly. &ldquo;Almost a thousand men on my pay roll. We
      have the biggest copper mine in the Rocky Mountain region, Mr. War-field.
      Come down some day and see the smelter,&rdquo; he added as he extended his
      hand in farewell greeting, with a leer rather than a smile on his face.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a pass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Roderick coldly. And the two friends resumed
      their walk toward Brig Young&rsquo;s saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you,&rdquo; remarked Grant, &ldquo;that
      Grady is the most pompous, arrogant and all-round hated man in this mining
      camp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks the part,&rdquo; replied Roderick, and they both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later they were seated in a cosy little restaurant. Ample justice
      was done to the succulent Wyoming porterhouse, and cigars were lighted
      over the cups of fragrant coffee that completed the meal. Then the young
      men resumed their peregrinations pursuant to the programme of visiting
      Brig Young&rsquo;s place, certified by Grant Jones to be one of the sights
      of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saloon proved to be an immense room with a bar in the corner near the
      entrance. Roulette tables, faro lay-outs and a dozen poker tables
      surrounded with feverish players were all running full blast, while half a
      hundred men were standing around waiting to take the place of any player
      who went broke or for any reason dropped out of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess nearly all the gambling is done here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      asked Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a big sight. There are eighteen joints of this kind, and
      they are all running wide open and doing business all the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do they close?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never close,&rdquo; replied Grant. &ldquo;Brig Young boasts
      that he threw the key away when this place opened, and the door has never
      been locked since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they spoke their attention was attracted to one corner of the gaming
      room. Seven players were grouped around a table, in the centre of which
      was stacked a pile of several thousand dollars in gold pieces. Grant and
      Roderick strolled over.
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of miners and cowboys were standing around watching the game. One
      of them said to Grant Jones: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jack pot and they&rsquo;re
      dealing for openers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally someone opened the pot for $500. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an all-fired
      juicy pot and I wouldn&rsquo;t think of openin&rsquo; it for less.&rdquo;
      Tom Lester was the player&rsquo;s name, as Grant whispered to Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; said One-Eyed Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The players were quickly assisted with cards&mdash;four refused to come
      in, and the other three, having thrown their discards into the deck, sat
      facing each other ready for the final struggle in determining the
      ownership of the big pot before them. It was a neck and neck proposition.
      First one would see and raise and then another would see and go better.
      Finally, the showdown came, and it created consternation when it was
      discovered that there were five aces in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Tom Lester jerked his Colt&rsquo;s revolver from his belt and
      laid it carefully down on top of his three aces and said: &ldquo;Steady,
      boys, don&rsquo;t move a muscle or a hand until I talk.&rdquo; The
      onlookers pushed back and quickly enlarged the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit perfectly still, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Tom Lester, quietly and
      in a low tone of voice, with his cocked revolver in front of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not makin&rsquo; any accusations or loud talk&mdash;I&rsquo;m not accusin&rsquo;
      anybody in particular of anything. Keep perfectly cool an&rsquo; hear a
      cool determined man talk. Far be it from me to accuse anyone of crooked
      dealin&rsquo; or holdin&rsquo; high cards up their sleeves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he looked at One-Eyed Joe who had both a reputation at card
      skin games and a record of several notches on his gun handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say,&rdquo; Lester continued, &ldquo;that I recognize in
      the game we&rsquo;re playin&rsquo; every man is a perfect gentleman and it&rsquo;s
      not Tom Lester who suspicions any impure motives or crooked work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will now order a new deck of cards,&rdquo; said Tom while fire
      was flashing out of his steel gray eyes. &ldquo;We will play this game to
      a finish, by God, and the honest winner will take the stakes. But I will
      say here and now so there may be no misunderstandin&rsquo; and without
      further notice, that if a fifth ace shows up again around this table, I&rsquo;ll
      shoot his other eye out.&rdquo; And he looked straight at One-Eyed Joe,
      who never quivered or moved a muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ends my remarks concernin&rsquo; the rules. How d&rsquo;ye
      like &lsquo;em, Joe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Joe, looking up in a surprised way with his one
      eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;lowin&rsquo; you have made yer position plain&mdash;so
      dangnation plain that even a blind man kin see the pint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The new deck was brought and the game went on in silence. After a few
      deals the pot was again opened, and was in due course won by a player who
      had taken no part in the previous mix-up, without a word falling from the
      lips of either Tom Lester or One-Eyed Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick and Grant moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great guns,&rdquo; exclaimed the former. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a
      rare glimpse of western life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are incidents like that every night,&rdquo; replied
      Grant, &ldquo;and shooting too at times. Have a drink?&rdquo; he added as
      they approached the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will have a great big lemonade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Grant, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surprise both you and
      my stomach by taking the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sipped their drinks, Grant&rsquo;s face became a little serious as
      he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad you have come. You seem to be of my
      own kind. Lots of good boys out here, but they are a little rough and many
      of them are rather careless. Guess I am getting a little careless myself.
      There are just two men in these mountains who have a good influence over
      the boys. One is Major Buell Hampton. Everybody trusts him. By the way, I
      must introduce you to him. He is one of the grandest men I have ever met&rdquo;
      As Grant said this he brought his fist down decisively on the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other is the Reverend Stephen Grannon,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;the travelling horseback preacher&mdash;carries saddle bags, and
      all that. Why, do you know, the boys are so respectful to Reverend Grannon
      that they hire a man to go up and down the street ringing a bell, and they
      close up all their places for an hour every time he comes to town. He
      preaches mostly in the big tent you perhaps saw further up the street, at
      other times in the little church. The boys are mighty respectful to him,
      and all because they know he goes about doing good. If anyone falls ill,
      Reverend Grannon is the first to offer help. He visits the poor and cheers
      them with a spirit of hope. He never leaves town without going into every
      saloon and shaking hands with the barkeepers, giving them the same kind of
      advice but not in the same way&mdash;the same advice that we used to get
      when we stood around our mother&rsquo;s knee before we had learned the
      sorrows of the big world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Grant was serious. Then looking up at Roderick, he laughed
      and said: &ldquo;We all have to think of those old days once in a while,
      don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I come to think of it,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;the present
      moment&rsquo;s a very good time. We&rsquo;ll go down and call on one of
      Nature&rsquo;s noblemen. He is somewhat of an enigma. You cannot tell how
      old he is by looking at him. He may have seen fifty years or a hundred and
      fifty&mdash;the Lord only knows, for nobody in this camp has any idea. But
      you will meet a magnificent character. Come along. I&rsquo;m going to
      present you to my friend, Major Buell Hampton, about whom I&rsquo;ve just
      been speaking. I guess we&rsquo;ll catch him at home.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;A PHILOSOPHER AMONG THE MOUNTAINS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S THE two young
      men walked down the brilliantly lighted main street of Encampment, Grant
      Jones explained that the water had been dammed several miles up the south
      fork of the Encampment river and conducted in a California red-wood pipe
      down to the smelter plant for power purposes; and that the town of
      Encampment was lighted at a less cost per capita than any other town in
      the world. It simply cost nothing, so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant had pointed out several residences of local celebrities, but at last
      a familiar name drew Roderick&rsquo;s special attention&mdash;the name of
      one of his father&rsquo;s old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Boney Earnest&rsquo;s home,&rdquo; Grant was remarking.
      &ldquo;He is the fellow who stands in front of the furnaces at the smelter
      in a sleeveless shirt and with a red bandana around his neck. They have a
      family of ten children, every one of them as bright as a new silver
      dollar. Oh, we have lots of children here and by the way a good public
      school. You see that log house just beyond? That is where Boney Earnest
      used to live when he first came into camp&mdash;before his brood was quite
      so numerous. It now belongs to Major Buell Hampton. It is not much to look
      at, but just wait until you get inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this Major Hampton, I presume, has furnished it up in great
      shape?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing but rough benches, a table, some chairs and a few
      shelves full of books. What I mean is that Major Hampton&rsquo;s
      personality is there and that beats all the rich furniture and all the
      bric-à-brac on earth. As a college man you will appreciate him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without ceremony Grant rapped vigorously at the door and received a loud
      response to &ldquo;come in.&rdquo; At the far end of a room that was
      perhaps 40 feet long by 20 feet in width was an open fireplace in which
      huge logs of wood were burning. Here Major Hampton was standing with his
      back to the fire and his hands crossed behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his visitors entered, the Major said in courtly welcome: &ldquo;Mr.
      Grant Jones, I am glad to see you.&rdquo; And he advanced with hand
      extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major, let me introduce you to a newcomer, Roderick Warfield. We
      belong to the same &lsquo;frat.&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Warfield,&rdquo; responded the Major, shaking the visitor&rsquo;s
      hand, &ldquo;I welcome you not only to the camp but to my humble dwelling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He led them forward and provided chairs in front of the open fire. On the
      center table was a humidor filled with tobacco and beside it lay several
      pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Warfield,&rdquo; observed the Major, speaking with a marked
      southern accent, &ldquo;I am indeed pleased, suh, to meet anyone who is a
      friend of Mr. Jones. I have found him a most delightful companion and I
      hope you will make free to call on me often. Interested in mining, I
      presume?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Roderick, &ldquo;interested, yes, in a way.
      But tentative arrangements have been made for me to join the cowboy
      brigade. I am to ride the range if Mr. Shields is pleased with me, as our
      friend here seems to think he will be. He is looking for some more cowboys
      and my name has been mentioned to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; concurred Grant, &ldquo;Mr. Shields needs some more
      cowboys very badly, and as Warfield is accustomed to riding, I&rsquo;m
      quite sure he&rsquo;ll fill the bill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; observed the Major, &ldquo;I am very much
      interested in mining. It has a great charm for me. The taking out of
      wealth from the bosom of the earth&mdash;wealth that has never been
      tainted by commercialism&mdash;appeals to me very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I presume you are doing some mining yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Major. &ldquo;If I had capital, doubtless I
      would be in the mining business. But my profession, if I may term it so,
      is that of a hunter. These hills and mountains are pretty full of game,
      and I manage to find two or three deer a week. My friend and next door
      neighbor, Mr. Boney Earnest, and his family consisting of a wife and ten
      children, have been very considerate of me and I have undertaken the
      responsibility of furnishing the meat for their table. Are you fond of
      venison, Mr. Warfield?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;I have never tasted
      venison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finest meat in the world,&rdquo; responded the Major. &ldquo;Of
      course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I aim to sell about one deer a week,
      which brings me a fair compensation. It enables me to buy tobacco and
      ammunition,&rdquo; and he laughed good naturedly at his limited wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would suppose,&rdquo; interjected Grant Jones, &ldquo;that the
      Boney Earnest family must be provided with phenomenal appetites if they
      eat the meat of two deer each week. But if you knew the Major&rsquo;s
      practice of supplying not less than a dozen poor families with venison
      because they are needy, you would understand why he does not have a
      greater income from the sale of these antlered trophies of the hills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major waved the compliment aside and lit his pipe. As he threw his
      head well back after the pipe was going, Roderick was impressed that Major
      Buell Hampton most certainly was an exceptional specimen of manhood. He
      was over six feet tall, splendidly proportioned, and perhaps weighed
      considerably more than two hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were little things here and there that gave an insight into the
      character of the man. Hanging on the wall was a broad-brimmed slouch hat
      of the southern planter style. Around his neck the Major wore a heavy gold
      watch guard with many a link. To those who knew him best, as Roderick came
      subsequently to learn, this chain was symbolical of his endless kindnesses
      to the poor&mdash;notwithstanding his own poverty, of such as he had he
      freely gave; like the chain his charities seemed linked together without a
      beginning&mdash;without an end. His well-brushed shoes and puttees, his
      neatly arranged Windsor tie, denoted the old school of refinement and good
      breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      His long dark hair and flowing mustaches were well streaked with gray. His
      forehead was knotted, his nose was large but well formed, while the
      tangled lines of his face were deep cut and noticeable. From under heavily
      thatched eyebrows the eyes beamed forth the rare tenderness and gentle
      consideration for others which his conversation suggested. Long before the
      evening&rsquo;s visit was over, a conviction was fixed in Roderick&rsquo;s
      heart that here indeed was a king among men&mdash;one on whom God had set
      His seal of greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In later days, when both had become well acquainted, Roderick sometimes
      discovered moments when this strange man was in deep meditation&mdash;when
      his eyes seemed resting far away on some mysterious past or inscrutable
      future. And Roderick would wonder whether it was a dark cloud of memory or
      anxiety for what was to come that obscured and momentarily dimmed the
      radiance of this great soul. It was in such moments that Major Buell
      Hampton became patriarchal in appearance; and an observer might well have
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Here is one over whom a hundred winters or even
      countless centuries have blown their fiercest chilling winds.&rdquo; But
      when Buell Hampton had turned again to things of the present, his face was
      lit up with his usual inspiring smile of preparedness to consider the
      simplest questions of the poorest among the poor of his acquaintances&mdash;a
      transfiguration indescribable, as if the magic work of some ancient
      alchemist had pushed the years away, transforming the centenarian into a
      comparatively young man who had seen, perhaps, not more than half a
      century. He was, indeed, changeable as a chameleon. But in all phases he
      looked, in the broadest sense of the word, the humanitarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the three men sat that night around the fire and gazed into the leaping
      flames and glowing embers, there had been a momentary lull in the
      conversation, broken at last by the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we shall become great friends, Mr. War-field,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;But to be friends we must be acquainted, and in order to be
      really acquainted with a man I must know his views on politics, religion,
      social questions, and the economic problems of the age in which we live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand at the bookshelves well filled with volumes whose worn
      bindings showed that they were there for reading and not for show. Long
      rows of periodicals, even stacks of newspapers, indicated close attention
      to the current questions of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a large order,&rdquo; replied Roderick, smiling. &ldquo;It
      would take a long time to test out a man in such a thorough way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major paid no heed to the comment. Still fixedly regarding the
      bookshelves, he continued: &ldquo;You see my library, while not extensive,
      represents my possessions. Each day is a link in life&rsquo;s chain, and I
      endeavor to keep pace with the latest thought and the latest steps in the
      world&rsquo;s progress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned round suddenly and asked the direct question: &ldquo;By the
      way, Mr. Warfield, are you a married man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick blushed the blush of a young bachelor and confessed that he was
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom God hath joined let no man put asunder,&rdquo; laughed Grant
      Jones. &ldquo;The good Lord has not joined me to anyone yet, but I am
      hoping He will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grant, you are a boy,&rdquo; laughed the Major. &ldquo;You always
      will be a boy. You are quick to discover the ridiculous; and yet,&rdquo;
      went on the Major reflectively, &ldquo;I have seen my friend Jones in
      serious mood at times. But I like him whether he is frivolous or serious.
      When you boys speak of marriage as something that is arranged by a Divine
      power, you are certainly laboring under one of the many delusions of this
      world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick remembered his compact with Stella Rain, the pretty little
      college widow. For a moment his mind was back at the campus grounds in old
      Galesburg. Presently he said: &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Major, but would
      you mind giving me your ideas of an ideal marriage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ideal marriage,&rdquo; repeated the Major, smiling, as he
      knocked the ashes from his meerschaum. &ldquo;Well, an ideal marriage is a
      something the young girl dreams about, a something the engaged girl
      believes she has found, and a something the married woman knows never
      existed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked deep into the open grate as if re-reading a half forgotten
      chapter in his own life. Presently refilling and lighting his pipe he
      turned to Roderick and said: &ldquo;When people enter into marriage&mdash;a
      purely civil institution&mdash;a man agrees to bring in the raw products&mdash;the
      meat, the flour, the corn, the fuel; and the woman agrees to manufacture
      the goods into usable condition. The husband agrees to provide a home&mdash;the
      wife agrees to take care of it and keep it habitable. In one respect
      marriage is slavery,&rdquo; continued the Major, &ldquo;slavery in the
      sense that each mutually sentences himself or herself to a life of
      servitude, each serving the other in, faithfully carrying out, when health
      permits, their contract or agreement of partnership. Therefore marriages
      are made on earth&mdash;not in heaven. There is nothing divine about them.
      They are, as I have said, purely a civil institution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker paused. His listeners, deeply interested, were reluctant by
      any interruption to break the flow of thought. They waited patiently, and
      presently the Major resumed: &ldquo;Since the laws of all civilized
      nations recognize the validity of a partnership contract, they should also
      furnish an honorable method of nullifying and cancelling it when either
      party willfully breaks the marriage agreement of partnership by act of
      omission or commission. Individuals belonging to those isolated cases
      &lsquo;Whom God hath joined&rsquo;&mdash;if perchance there are any&mdash;of
      course have no objections to complying with the formalities of the
      institutions of marriage; they are really mated and so the divorce court
      has no terrors for them. It is only from among the great rank and file of
      the other class whom &lsquo;God hath <i>not</i> joined&rsquo; that the
      unhappy victims are found hovering around the divorce courts, claiming
      that the partnership contract has been violated and broken and the erring
      one has proven a false and faithless partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In most instances, I believe, and it is the saddest part of it all,
      the complainant is usually justified. And it is certainly a most wise,
      necessary, and humane law that enables an injured wife or husband to
      terminate a distasteful or repulsive union. Only in this way can the
      standard of humanity be raised by peopling the earth with natural
      love-begotten children, free from the effects of unfavorable pre-natal
      influences which not infrequently warp and twist the unborn into embryonic
      imbeciles or moral perverts with degenerate tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society as well as posterity is indebted fully as much to the civil
      institution of divorce as it is to the civil institution of marriage. Oh,
      yes, I well know, pious-faced church folks walk about throughout the land
      with dubs to bludgeon those of my belief without going to the trouble of
      submitting these vital questions to an unprejudiced court of inquiry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major smiled, and said: &ldquo;I see you young men are interested in
      my diatribe, or my sermon&mdash;call it which you will&mdash;so I&rsquo;ll
      go on. Well, the churches that are nearest to the crudeness of antiquity,
      superstition, and ignorance are the ones most unyielding and denunciatory
      to the institution of divorce. The more progressive the church or the
      community and the more enlightened the human race becomes, the less
      objectionable and the more desirable is an adequate system of divorce laws&mdash;laws
      that enable an injured wife or husband to refuse to stultify their
      conscience and every instinct of decency by bringing children into the
      world that are not welcome. A womanly woman covets motherhood&mdash;desires
      children&mdash;love offerings with which to people the earth&mdash;babes
      that are not handicapped with parental hatreds, regrets, or disgust.
      Marriage is not a flippant holiday affair but a most serious one,
      freighted not alone with grave responsibilities to the mutual happiness of
      both parties to the civil contract, but doubly so to the offspring
      resultant from the union. But I guess that is about enough of my
      philosophy for one evening, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he concluded, with a
      little laugh that was not devoid of bitterness&mdash;it might have been
      the bitterness of personal reminiscence, or bitterness toward a blind and
      misguided world in general, or perhaps both combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones turning to Roderick said: &ldquo;Well, what do you think of
      the Major&rsquo;s theory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said Roderick in a serious tone, &ldquo;that it is
      not a theory but an actual condition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; said the Major as he arose from his chair and
      advanced to Roderick, extending his hand. &ldquo;All truth,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;in time will be uncovered, truth that today is hidden beneath
      the débris of formalities, ignorance, and superstition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, Major,&rdquo; asked Grant, &ldquo;are there so many
      divorces? Do not contracting parties know their own minds? Now it seems
      impossible to conceive of my ever wanting a divorce from a certain little
      lady I know,&rdquo; he added with a pleasant laugh&mdash;the care-free,
      confiding laugh of a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jones,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;the supposed reasons
      for divorce are legion&mdash;the actual reasons are perhaps few. However
      it is not for me to say that all the alleged reasons are not potent and
      sufficient. When we hear two people maligning each other in or out of the
      court we are prone to believe both are telling the truth. Truth is the
      underlying foundation of respect, respect begets friendship, and
      friendship sometimes is followed by the more tender passion we call love.
      A man meets a woman,&rdquo; the Major went on, thoughtfully, &ldquo;whom
      he knows is not what the world calls virtuous. He may fall in love with
      her and may marry her and be happy with her. But if a man loves a woman he
      believes to be virtuous and then finds she is not&mdash;it is secretly
      regarded by him as the unforgivable sin and is doubtless the unspoken and
      unwritten allegation in many a divorce paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He mused for a moment, then went on: &ldquo;Sometime there will be a
      single standard of morals for the sexes, but as yet we are not far enough
      away from the brutality of our ancestors. Yes, it is infinitely better,&rdquo;
      he added, rising from his chair, &ldquo;that a home should be broken into
      a thousand fragments through the kindly assistance of a divorce court
      rather than it should only exist as a family battle ground.&rdquo; The
      tone of his voice showed that the talk was at an end, and he bade his
      visitors a courteous good-night, with the cordial addition: &ldquo;Come
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was great,&rdquo; remarked Roderick, as the young men wended
      their homeward way. &ldquo;What a wealth of new thought a fellow can bring
      away from such a conversation!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I told you,&rdquo; replied Grant &ldquo;But the Major opens
      his inmost heart like that only to his chosen friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m mighty glad to be enrolled among the number,&rdquo;
      said Roderick. &ldquo;Makes a chap feel rather shy of matrimony though,
      doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life. True love can never change&mdash;can never wrong
      itself. When you feel that way toward a girl, Warfield, and know that the
      girl is of the same mind, go and get the license&mdash;no possible mistake
      can be made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones was thinking of Dorothy Shields, and his face was aglow. To
      Roderick had come thought of Stella Rain, and he felt depressed. Was there
      no mistake in his love affair?&mdash;this was the uneasy question that was
      beginning to call for an answer. And yet he had never met a girl whom he
      would prefer to the dainty, sweet, unselfish, brave little &ldquo;college
      widow&rdquo; of Galesburg.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE HIDDEN VALLEY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ITHIN a few days
      of Roderick&rsquo;s advent into the camp he was duly added to the cowboy
      list on the ranch of the wealthy cattleman, Mr. Shields, whose property
      was located a few miles east from the little mining town and near the
      banks of the Platte River. A commodious and handsome home stood apart from
      the cattle corral and bunk house lodgings for the cowboy helpers. There
      were perhaps twenty cowboys in Mr. Shields&rsquo; employment. His vast
      herds of cattle ranged in the adjoining hills and mountain canyons that
      rimmed the eastern edge of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones had proved his friendship in the strongest sort of an
      introduction, and was really responsible for Roderick securing a job so
      quickly. But it was not many days before Roderick discovered that Doro-try
      Shields was perhaps the principal reason why Grant rode over to the ranch
      so often, ostensibly to visit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first month Roderick did not leave the ranch but daily
      familiarized himself with horse and saddle. He had always been a good
      rider, but here he learned the difference between a trained steed and an
      unbroken mustang. Many were his falls and many his bruises, but finally he
      came to be quite at home on the back of the fiercest bucking broncho.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Saturday evening he concluded to look up Grant Jones and perhaps have
      another evening with Major Buell Hampton. So he saddled a pony and
      started. But at the edge of town he met his friend riding toward the
      country. They drew rein, and Grant announced, as Roderick had already
      divined, that he was just starting for the Shields home. They finally
      agreed to call on Major Buell Hampton for half an hour and then ride out
      to the ranch together.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached Major Hampton&rsquo;s place they found him mounting his
      horse, having made ready for the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this, Major?&rdquo; asked Grant Jones. &ldquo;Is it not
      rather late in the afternoon for you to be starting away with your trusty
      rifle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the Major, after saluting his callers most
      cordially, &ldquo;yes, it is late. But I know where there is a deer lick,
      and as I am liable to lose my reputation as a hunter if I do not bring in
      a couple more venisons before long, why I propose to be on the ground with
      the first streak of daylight tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the afternoon sun and said: &ldquo;I think I can reach the
      deer lick soon after sun-down. I shall remain over night and be ready for
      the deer when they first begin stirring. They usually frequent the lick I
      intend visiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major seemed impatient to be gone and soon his horse was cantering
      along carrying him into the hills, while Roderick and Grant were riding
      leisurely through the lowlands of the valley road toward the Shields
      ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the afternoon Buell Hampton skirted numerous rocky banks and
      crags and climbed far up into the mountain country, then down abrupt
      hill-sides only to mount again to still higher elevations. He was
      following a dim trail with which he showed himself familiar and that led
      several miles away to Spirit River Falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near these falls was the deer lick. For three consecutive trips the hunter
      had been unsuccessful. He had witnessed fully a dozen deer disappear along
      the trail that led down to the river&rsquo;s bank, but none of them had
      returned. It was a mystery. He did not understand where the deer could
      have gone. There was no ford or riffle in the river and the waters were
      too deep to admit belief of the deer finding a crossing. He wondered what
      was the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the real reason why he had left home late that afternoon,
      determined, when night came on, to tether his horse in the woods far away
      from the deer lick, make camp and be ready the following morning for the
      first appearance of some fine buck as he came to slake his thirst. If he
      did not get that buck he would at least find the trail&mdash;indeed on the
      present occasion it was less the venison he was after than the solving of
      the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at his destination, the improvised camp was leisurely made and
      his horse given a generous feed of oats. After this he lighted a fire, and
      soon a steaming cup of coffee helped him to relish the bread and cold meat
      with which he had come provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      After smoking several pipes of tobacco and building a big log fire for the
      night&mdash;for the season was far advanced and there was plenty of snow
      around&mdash;Buell Hampton lay down in his blankets and was soon fast
      asleep, indifferent to the blinking stars or to the rhythmic stirring of
      clashing leafless limbs fanned into motion by the night winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first breaking of dawn the Major was stirring. After refreshing
      himself with hot coffee and glancing at the cartridges in his rifle, he
      stole silently along under the overhanging foliage toward the deer lick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watcher had hardly taken a position near an old fallen tree when five
      deer came timidly along the trail, sniffing the air in a half suspicious
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifting his rifle to his shoulder the hunter took deliberate aim and
      fired. A young buck leaped high in the air, wheeled about from the trail
      and plunged madly toward his enemy. But it was the stimulated madness of
      death. The noble animal fell to its knees&mdash;then partially raised
      itself with one last mighty effort only to fall back again full length,
      vanquished in the uneven battle with man. The Major&rsquo;s hunting knife
      quickly severed the jugular vein and the animal was thoroughly bled. A
      little later this first trophy of the chase had been dressed and gambreled
      with the dexterity of a stock yard butcher and hung high on the limb of a
      near by tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four remaining deer, when the Major fired, had rushed frantically down
      the trail bordered with dense underbrush and young trees that led over the
      brow of the embankment and on down to the river. The hunter now started in
      pursuit, following the trail to the water&rsquo;s edge. But there were no
      deer to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking closely he noted that the tracks turned directly to the left
      toward the waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bank was very abrupt, but by hugging it closely and stepping sometimes
      on stones in the water, while pushing the overhanging and tangled
      brushwood aside, he succeeded in making some headway. To his surprise the
      narrow trail gave evidence of much use, as the tracks were indeed
      numerous. But where, he asked himself, could it possibly lead? However, he
      was determined to persevere and solve the mystery of where the deer had
      gone and thus escaped him on the previous occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he had traversed the short distance to the great cataract
      tumbling over the shelf of rock almost two hundred feet above. Here he
      found himself under the drooping limbs of a mammoth tree that grew so
      close to the waterfall that the splashing spray enveloped him like a cold
      shower. Following on, to his astonishment he reached a point behind the
      waterfall where he discovered a large cavern with lofty arched roof, like
      an immense hall in some ancient ruined castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the light was imperfect yet the morning sun, which at that hour
      shone directly on the cascade, illuminated up the cavern sufficiently for
      the Major to see into it for quite a little distance. It seemed to recede
      directly into the mountain. The explorer cautiously advanced, and soon was
      interested at another discovery. A stream fully fifteen feet wide and
      perhaps two feet deep flowed directly out of the heart of the mountain
      along the center of the grotto, to mingle its waters with those of Spirit
      River at the falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton paused to consider this remarkable discovery. He now
      remembered that the volume of Spirit River had always impressed him as
      being larger below the noted Spirit River Falls than above, and here was
      the solution. The falls marked the junction of two bodies of water. Where
      this hidden river came from he had no idea. Apparently its source was some
      great spring situated far back in the mountain&rsquo;s interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major was tensioned to a high key, and determined to investigate
      further. Making his way slowly and carefully along the low stone shelf
      above the river, he found that the light did not penetrate more than about
      three hundred feet. Looking closely he found there was an abundance of
      deer sign, which greatly mystified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retracing his steps to the waterfall, the Major once more crept along the
      path next to the abrupt river bank, and, climbing up the embankment,
      regained the deer trail where he had shot the young buck. He seated
      himself on an old fallen tree. Here on former occasions Major Hampton had
      waited many an hour for the coming of deer and indulged in day-dreaming
      how to relieve the ills of humanity, how to lighten the burdens of the
      poor and oppressed. Now, however, he was roused to action, and was no
      longer wrapped in the power of silence and the contemplation of abstract
      subjects. His brain and his heart were throbbing with the excitement of
      adventure and discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After full an hour&rsquo;s thought his decision was reached and a course
      of action planned. First of all he proceeded to gather a supply of dry
      brush and branches, tying them into three torch-like bundles with stout
      cord, a supply of which he invariably carried in his pockets. Then he
      inspected his match box to make sure the matches were in good condition.
      Finally picking up his gun, pulling his hunting belt a little tighter,
      examining his hatchet and knife to see if they were safe in his belt
      scabbard, he again set forth along the deer trail, down to the river.
      Overcoming the same obstacles as before, he soon found himself in the
      grotto behind the waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lighting one of his torches the Major started on a tour of further
      discovery. His course again led him over the comparatively smooth ledge of
      rock that served as a low bank for the waters of the hidden stream. But
      now he was able to advance beyond the point previously gained. After a
      while his torch burned low and he lighted another. The subterranean
      passage he was traversing narrowed at times until there was scarcely more
      than room to walk along the brink of the noisy waters, and again it would
      widen out like some great colosseum. The walls and high ceilings were
      fantastically enchanting, while the light from his torch made strange
      shadows, played many tricks on his nerves, and startled him with optical
      illusions. Figures of stalactites and rows of basaltic columns reflected
      the flare of the brand held aloft, and sometimes the explorer fancied
      himself in a vault hung with tapestries of brilliant sparkling crystals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the third and last torch was almost burned down to the hand hold
      and the Major began to awaken to a keen sense of his difficult position,
      and its possible dangers. When attempting to change the stub of burning
      brushwood from one hand to the other and at the same time not drop his
      rifle, the remnants of the torch fell from his grasp into the rapid
      flowing waters and he was left in utter darkness. Apprehension came upon
      him&mdash;an eerie feeling of helplessness. True, there was a box of
      matches in the pocket of his hunting coat, but these would afford but
      feeble guidance in a place where at any step there might be a pitfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton was a philosopher, but this was a new experience, startling
      and unique. Everything around was pitch dark. He seemed to be enveloped in
      a smothering black robe. Presently above the murmur and swish of running
      water he could hear his heart beating. He mentally figured that he must
      have reached a distance of not less than three miles from Spirit River
      Falls. The pathway had proved fairly smooth walking, but unknown dangers
      were ahead, while a return trip in Stygian darkness would be an ordeal
      fraught with much risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping over the low bank he thrust his hand into the current to make
      sure of its course. The water was only a little below the flat ledge of
      rock on which he was standing, and was cold as the waters of a mountain
      spring. It occurred to him that he had been thirsty for a long time
      although in his excitement he had not been conscious of this. So he lay
      down flat and thrust his face into the cool grateful water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising again to his feet he felt greatly refreshed, his nerve restored,
      and he had just about concluded to retrace his steps when his eyes, by
      this time somewhat accustomed to the darkness, discovered in an upstream
      direction, a tiny speck of light He blinked and then questioningly rubbed
      his eyes. But still the speck did not disappear. It seemed no larger than
      a silver half dollar. It might be a ray of light filtering through some
      crevice, indicating a tunnel perhaps that would afford means of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using his gun as a staff wherewith to feel his way and keeping as far as
      possible from the water&rsquo;s edge, Major Hampton moved slowly upstream
      toward the guiding spot of radiance. In a little while he became convinced
      it was the light of day shining in through an opening. The speck grew
      larger and larger as he slowly moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every once in a while he would stop and turn his face in the opposite
      direction, remaining in this position for a few moments and then quickly
      turning round again to satisfy himself that he was under no illusion. But
      the luminous disc was really growing larger&mdash;it appeared now to be as
      big as a saucer. His heart throbbed with hope and his judgment approved
      that the advance should be continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the light was increasing, and looking down he fancied he could almost
      see the butt of his gun which was being used as a walking stick. Presently
      his feet could indistinctly be seen, and then the rocky pavement over
      which he was so cautiously shuffling his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later the mouth of a tunnel was reached, and he was safe once
      more, bathed in God&rsquo;s own sunshine, his eyes still dazzled after the
      Cimmerian blackness from which he had emerged. He had traversed the entire
      length of the subterranean cave or river channel, and had reached the
      opposite side of a high mountain. Perhaps the distance through was only
      about three and a half miles. Trees and underbrush grew in profusion about
      the mouth of the tunnel into which the hidden river flowed. There was less
      snow than on the other side of the barrier. Deer sign were everywhere, and
      he followed a zig-zag deer path out into an open narrow valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major&rsquo;s heart now leaped with the exultation of accomplishment.
      Brushing the light covering of snow away, he seated himself on the bank of
      the stream which could not, now that he looked upon it in the open day, be
      dignified by calling it a river. Along the edges of the watercourse were
      fringes of ice but in the center the rapid flow was unobstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a big mountain brook, but one perhaps that had never been seen
      before by the eyes of man. The exploration and the excitement together had
      greatly fatigued Buell Hampton, and he was beginning to be conscious of
      physical exhaustion and the need of food notwithstanding the sustaining
      stimulus of being a discoverer in one of Nature&rsquo;s jealously guarded
      wonderlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After resting a short time he started to walk farther into the valley and
      forage along the stream. The hunter was on the lookout for grouse but
      succeeded in shooting only a young sage hen. This was quickly dressed and
      broiled, the forked stick that served as a spit being skilfully turned in
      the blaze of a fire of twigs and brushwood. The repast was a modest one,
      but the wayfarer felt greatly refreshed, and now stepped briskly on,
      following the water channel toward its fountain head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a beautiful valley&mdash;an ideal one&mdash;very little snow
      and the deer so plentiful that at a distance they might be mistaken for
      flocks of grazing sheep. The valley appeared to be exceedingly fertile in
      season. It was a veritable park, and so far as the explorer could at
      present determine was completely surrounded by high snow-capped mountains
      which were steep enough to be called precipices. He soon came to a dyke
      that ran across the valley at right angles to the stream. It was of
      porphyry formation, rising to a height of from three to four feet, and
      reaching right across the narrow valley from foothill to foothill. When
      Major Hampton climbed upon this dyke he noticed that the swiftly flowing
      brook had cut an opening through it as evenly almost as if the work had
      been chiseled by man. He was anxious to know whether the valley would lead
      to an opening from among the mountains, and after a brief halt pushed
      hurriedly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But an hour later he had retraced his steps and was again seated on the
      bench-like dyke of porphyry. He had made a complete circuit of this
      strange &ldquo;nest&rdquo; or gash in the vastness of the Rocky Mountain
      Range and was convinced there was no opening. The brook had its rise in a
      number of mammoth springs high up on the mountain foothills at the upper
      end of the valley, where it was also fed by several waterfalls that
      dropped from the dizzy cliffs far above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley was perhaps three miles long east and west and not over
      one-half mile wide north and south. The contour of the mountain sides to
      the south conformed to the contour on the north, justifying the reasonable
      conjecture that an earthquake or violent volcanic upheaval must have tom
      the mountains apart in prehistoric times. It was evidently in all truth a
      hidden valley&mdash;not on the map of the U. S. Survey&mdash;a veritable
      new land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; mused the Major, aloud, &ldquo;that I have
      discovered a new possession. What an asylum for the weary! Surely the day
      has been full of startling surprises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seated on the dyke almost at the very edge of the brock where the
      waters were singing their song of peaceful content. He let his glance
      again sweep the valley with the satisfied look of one conscious of some
      unanalyzed good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no snow on the porphyry dyke where he rested. It was
      moss-covered in many places with the coating of countless centuries. Most
      likely no human foot but his had ever pressed the sod of this sequestered
      nook among the mighty mountains. The very thought was uplifting&mdash;inspiring.
      Pulling his hunter&rsquo;s hatchet from its sheath he said aloud: &ldquo;I
      christen thee &lsquo;Hidden Valley,&rsquo;&rdquo;and struck the porphyry
      rock a vigorous blow, so vigorous indeed that it chipped off a goodly
      piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Buell Hampton paused, astonished. He looked and then he looked
      again. He picked up the chipped off piece of rock and gazed long and
      earnestly at it, then rubbed his eyes in amazement. It was literally
      gleaming with pure gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the hatchet again came into play. Piece after piece was broken
      open and all proved to be alike&mdash;rich specimens fit for the cabinet
      of a collector. The drab moss-covered dyke really contained the wealth of
      a King Solomon&rsquo;s mine. It was true&mdash;true, though almost
      unbelievable. Yet in this moment of overwhelming triumph Buell Hampton saw
      not with the eyes of avarice and greed for personal gain, but rather with
      the vision of the humanitarian. Unlimited wealth had always been for him a
      ravishing dream, but he had longed for it, passionately, yearningly, not
      as a means to supply pleasures for himself but to assuage the miseries of
      a suffering world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not skilled in judging rock carrying values of precious metals, but
      in this instance the merest novice could hardly be mistaken. Hastily
      breaking as much of the golden ore as he could carry in his huge coat
      pockets and taking one last sweeping survey over the valley, the Major
      started on his return trip to Spirit River Falls. Arriving at the point
      where the waters of the brook disappeared in the natural tunnel of the
      &ldquo;Hidden River,&rdquo; the name he mentally gave to the romantic
      stream, he gathered some torch material and then started on the return
      trip. Two hours later he emerged from behind the turbulent waters at
      Spirit River Falls. In the waning afternoon he regained his camp. After
      watering his patient horse, giving it another feed of oats and apologizing
      with many a gentle caressing pat for his long absence and seeming neglect,
      the Major set out for home, the dressed deer strapped on behind his
      saddle, with the deer skin rolled around the venison as a protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the following morning Buell Hampton visited an assay office,
      carrying with him an ore sack containing nine pounds and a half of ore.
      The Major felt certain it was ore&mdash;gold ore, almost pure gold&mdash;but
      was almost afraid of his own convictions. The discovery was really too
      good to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assayer tossed the sack of gold onto a table where other samples were
      awaiting his skill and said: &ldquo;All right, Major, come in sometime
      tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; replied the Major, &ldquo;that you
      assay it at once. It is high grade; I wish to sell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; replied the assayer with elevated eyebrows. Possibly
      he was like many another who encouraged the &ldquo;high-graders&rdquo; in
      their nefarious thefts from their employers when they were trusted to work
      on a rich property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Major Hampton, I didn&rsquo;t know you were one of &lsquo;em&mdash;one
      of us,&rdquo; and he finished with a leer and a laugh. &ldquo;Bet I can
      tell what mine it came from,&rdquo; he went on as he leisurely untied the
      ore sacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will remain right here,&rdquo; replied Major Hampton firmly,
      without yielding to the assayer&rsquo;s offensive hilarity, &ldquo;until
      you have my samples assayed and make me an offer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the sack of rock had been emptied into an ore pan and the
      astonishment depicted on the assayer&rsquo;s countenance would have
      beggared description. The sight of the ore staggered him into silence.
      Other work was pushed hurriedly aside and before very long the fire test
      was in process of being made. When finally finished the &ldquo;button&rdquo;
      weighed at the rate of $114.67 per pound, and the assayer, still half
      bewildered, handed over a check for almost eleven hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he almost shouted, &ldquo;I say, Major Hampton, where
      in hell did that ore come from? Surely not from any of the producing mines
      about here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be a producer, all right,&rdquo; replied the Major, as
      he folded the check and placed it in his pocketbook.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;THE FAIR RIDER OF THE RANGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Buell Hampton
      left the assayer&rsquo;s office he felt a chilliness in the air that
      caused him to cast his eyes upwards. There had been bright sunshine early
      that morning, but now the whole sky was overcast with a dull monotonous
      gray pall. Not a breath of wind was stirring; there was just a cold
      stillness in the air that told its own tale to those experienced in the
      weather signs of the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow,&rdquo; muttered the Major, emphatically. &ldquo;It has been
      long in coming this winter, but we&rsquo;ll have a big fall by night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The season indeed had been exceptionally mild. There had been one or two
      flurries of snow, but each had been followed by warm days and the light
      fall had speedily melted, at least in the open valley. High up, the
      mountains had their white garb of winter, but even at these elevations
      there had been no violent storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton, however, realized that the lingering autumn was now gone,
      and that soon the whole region would be in the rigorous grip of the Snow
      King. Henceforth for some months to come would be chill winds, protracted
      and frequently recurring downfalls of snow, great high-banked snowdrifts
      in the canyons, and later on the mighty snowslides that sheared
      timber-clad mountain slopes as if with a giant&rsquo;s knife and
      occasionally brought death and destruction to some remote mining camp. For
      the present the Major&rsquo;s hunting expeditions were at an end. But as
      he glanced at the heavy canopy of snow-laden cloud he also knew that days
      must elapse, weeks perhaps, before he could revisit the hidden valley high
      up in the mountains. For yet another winter tide Nature would hold her
      treasure safe from despoiling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton faced the situation with characteristic philosophy. All
      through the afternoon he mused on his good fortune. He was glad to have
      brought down even only a thousand dollars from the golden storehouse, for
      this money would ensure comfort during the inclement season for a good few
      humble homes. Meanwhile, like a banker with reserves of bullion safely
      locked up in his vault, he could plan out the future and see how the
      treasure was to be placed to best advantage. In Buell Hampton&rsquo;s case
      the field of investment was among the poor and struggling, and the only
      dividends he cared for were increased percentages of human happiness. The
      coming of winter only delayed the good work he had in mind, but even now
      the consciousness of power to perform brought great joy to his heart.
      Alone in his home he paced the big room, only pausing at times to throw
      another log on the fire or gaze awhile into the glowing embers,
      day-dreaming, unspeakably happy in his day-dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in anticipation of the coming snowstorm, young Warfield was
      riding the range and gathering cattle and yearlings that had strayed away
      from the herd. As he was surmounting a rather steep foothill across the
      valleys to the westward between the two Encampment rivers, he was startled
      at hearing the patter of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs. Quickly looking up he saw
      a young woman on horseback dashing swiftly along and swinging a lariat.
      She wore a divided brown skirt, wide sombrero, fringed gauntlets, and sat
      her horse with graceful ease and confidence. She was coming down the
      mountainside at right angles to his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bringing his pony quickly to a standstill Roderick watched the spirited
      horse-woman as she let go her lariat at an escaping yearling that
      evidently had broken out of some corral The lariat went straight to its
      mark, and almost at the same moment he heard her voice as she spoke to her
      steed, quickly but in soft melodious tones: &ldquo;That will do,
      Fleetfoot. Whoa!&rdquo; Instantly the well-trained horse threw himself
      well back on his haunches and veered to the left. The fleeing yearling was
      caught around one of its front feet and thrown as neatly as the most
      expert cowboy on the range could have done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George,&rdquo; said Roderick to himself, &ldquo;what a fine
      piece of work.&rdquo; He watched with admiring eyes as the young lady sat
      her horse in an attitude of waiting. Presently a cowboy rode up, and
      relieving her of the catch started the yearling back, evidently toward the
      corral. Turning about, the horsewoman started her horse at a canter
      directly toward him, and Roderick fell to wondering what sort of a
      discovery he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she brought her horse to a standstill and acknowledged his
      salutation as he lifted his sombrero. He saw the red blood glowing under
      the soft tan of her cheeks, and as their eyes met he was fairly dazzled by
      her beauty. He recognized at a glance the western type of girl, frank and
      fearless, accustomed to the full and health-giving freedom of life in the
      open, yet accomplished and domesticated, equally at home in the most
      tastefully adorned drawing room as here on horseback among the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; he said in a stammering way, &ldquo;but can I
      be of any service?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At his words she pulled her pony to a standstill and said: &ldquo;In what
      way, pray?&rdquo;&mdash;and there was a mischievous smile at Roderick&rsquo;s
      obvious embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I saw you lariating a yearling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, throwing back her head and laughing softly,
      &ldquo;that was a long time ago. It is doubtless in the corral by now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Roderick dismounted. He was capable now of assimilating
      details, and noted the silken dark Egyptian locks that fell in fluffy
      waves over her temples in a most bewitching manner, and the eyes that
      shone with the deep dark blue of the sapphire. His gaze must have betrayed
      his admiration, for, courteously waving her hand, she touched with her
      spurs the flanks of her mount and bounded away across the hills. Roderick
      was left standing in wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the dickens can she be?&rdquo; he soliloquized. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been riding the range for a good many weeks, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve
      spotted this mountain beauty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing himself onto his horse, he started down toward the south fork of
      the Encampment river and on to the westward the Shields ranch, wondering
      as he rode along who this strange girl of the hills could be. Once or
      twice he thought of Stella Rain and he manfully endeavored to keep his
      mind concentrated on the one to whom he was betrothed, running over in
      memory her last letter, reckoning the time that must elapse before the
      next one would arrive, recalling the tender incidents of their parting now
      two months ago. But his efforts were in vain. Always there kept recurring
      the vision of loveliness he had encountered on the range, and the mystery
      that surrounded the fair rider&rsquo;s identity. Once again since Major
      Buell Hampton&rsquo;s long diatribe on love and matrimony, he was vaguely
      conscious that his impetuous love-making on that memorable evening at
      Galesburg might have been a mistake, and that the little &ldquo;college
      widow&rdquo; in her unselfishness had spoken words of wisdom when she had
      counselled him to wait awhile&mdash;until he really did know his own mind&mdash;until
      he had really tried out his own heart, yes, until&mdash;Great heavens, he
      found himself recalling her very words, spoken with tears in her soft
      pretty eyes: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble, Roderick. You do not
      know&mdash;you cannot make a comparison, nor you won&rsquo;t know until
      the other girl comes along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the other girl at last come? But at the disloyal thought he spurred
      his horse to a gallop, and as he did so the first snowflakes of the coming
      storm fluttered cold and damp against his flushed cheeks. At last he
      thought of other things; he was wondering now, as he glanced around into
      the thickening atmosphere, whether all the stray mavericks were at last
      safe in the winter pastures and corrals.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;WINTER PASSES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT night the big
      snow storm did indeed come, and when Roderick woke up next morning it was
      to find mountain and valley covered with a vast bedspread of immaculate
      white and the soft snowflakes still descending like a feathery down. The
      storm did not catch Mr. Shields unprepared; his vast herds were safe and
      snug in their winter quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The break in the weather marked the end of Roderick&rsquo;s range riding
      for the season. He was now a stock feeder and engaged in patching up the
      corrals and otherwise playing his part of a ranch hand. And with this
      stay-at-home life he found himself thinking more and more of the real
      mission that had brought him into this land of mountains. Nearly every
      night when his work was finished, he studied a certain map of the hills&mdash;the
      inheritance left him by his father. On this map were noted &ldquo;Sheep
      Mountain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bennet Peak,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hahn&rsquo;s Peak&rdquo;
      and several other prominent landmarks. From his own acquaintance with the
      country Roderick now knew that the lost valley was quite a distance to the
      south and west from the Shields ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the wintry days wore on, and with their passing Roderick became more
      and more firm in his determination to be ready, when the snow was gone in
      the spring, to take up his father&rsquo;s unfinished task of finding again
      the sandbar abounding with nuggets of gold. Indeed in his life of
      isolation it gradually came about that he thought of little else by day
      and dreamed of nothing else at night. Sometimes in the solitude of his
      room he smiled at his loneliness. What a change from the old college days&mdash;from
      the stir and excitement of New York. During the winter he had been invited
      to a score of gatherings, dances, and parties, but somehow he had become
      taciturn and had declined all invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with stern self-control he had succeeded in putting out of mind the
      mysterious beauty of the range. Love at first sight!&mdash;he had laughed
      down such silliness, and rooted out of his heart the base treason that had
      even for a fleeting moment permitted such a thought. Yes, there was
      nothing but firmest loyalty in his mind for Stella Rain, who was waiting
      for him so faithfully and patiently, and whose letters cheered him and
      filled him with greater determination than ever to find the lost mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      His labors on the ranch were arduous but his health was excellent. At
      college he had been an athlete&mdash;now he was a rugged, bronzed-faced
      son of the hills. His only recreations were laying plans for the future
      and writing letters to Stella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not infrequently his mind wandered back to Keokuk, the old river town, and
      his heart grew regretful that he had quarreled with his Unde Allen Miller,
      and his thoughts were tender of his Aunt Lois. Once he wrote a letter to
      Whitley Adams, then tore it up in a dissatisfied way, returning to the
      determination to make his fortune before communicating with his old
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the winter passed, and spring had come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one morning in early May, just after he had finished his chores,
      when to his surprise Grant Jones shouted to him through the corral fence:
      &ldquo;Hello, old man, how is ranching agreeing with you, anyway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; responded Roderick, &ldquo;fine and dandy.&rdquo; He
      let himself through the gate of the corral and shook hands with Grant.
      &ldquo;Come up to the bunk house; seems mighty good to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; responded Grant, as they walked along. &ldquo;Do you
      know, Warfield, I have been shut up over on the other side of the range
      ever since that first big snow-storm? I paddled out on snowshoes only once
      during the winter, and then walked over the tops of trees. Plenty of
      places up on the Sierra Madre,&rdquo; continued Grant, nodding his head to
      the westward, &ldquo;where the snow is still twenty to thirty feet deep.
      If a fellow had ever broken through, why, of course, he would have been
      lost until the spring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible to think about,&rdquo; said Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; said Grant with his old exuberant
      laugh. &ldquo;It would have been so devilish long from a fellow&rsquo;s
      passing until his obituary came to be written. That is what gets on my
      nerves when I&rsquo;m out on snowshoes. Of course the columns of the <i>Doublejack</i>
      are always open to write-ups on dead unfortunates, but it likes to have
      &lsquo;em as near as possible to the actual date of demise. Then it&rsquo;s
      live news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds rather grewsome,&rdquo; said Roderick, smiling at Grant&rsquo;s
      oddity of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the bunk house, they were soon seated around a big stove where
      a brisk fire was burning, for the air without was still sharp and the wind
      cutting and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can offer you a pipe and some mighty fine tobacco,&rdquo; said
      Roderick, pushing a tray toward him carrying a jar of tobacco and
      half-a-dozen cob pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smells good,&rdquo; commented Grant, as he accepted and began to
      fill one of the pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell me something about yourself, Grant. I supposed the
      attraction over here at the ranch was quite enough to make you brave
      snowstorms and snow-slides and thirty-foot snowdrifts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warfield,&rdquo; said Grant, half seriously, between puffs at his
      pipe, &ldquo;that is what I want to talk with you about. The inducement is
      sufficient for all you suggest. She is a wonder. Without any question,
      Dorothy Shields is the sweetest girl that ever lived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; smiled Roderick. &ldquo;There may be others in the
      different parts of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; ejaculated Grant with a rising inflection, while
      his countenance suggested an interrogation point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have no confessions to make,&rdquo; rejoined Roderick, as he
      struck a match to light his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just what is troubling me,&rdquo; said Grant,
      still serious. &ldquo;I was just wondering if anyone else had been
      browsing on my range over here at the Shields ranch while I have been
      penned up like a groundhog, getting out my weekly edition of the <i>Dillon
      Doublejock</i>, sometimes only fifty papers at an issue. Think of it!&rdquo;
      And they both laughed at the ludicrous meagerness of such a circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never mind,&rdquo; continued Grant, reflectively, &ldquo;I will
      run my subscriptions up to three or four hundred in sixty days when the
      snow is off the ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is all very well, old man. But when will the snow be off?
      I am considerably interested myself, for I want to do some prospecting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang your prospecting,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;or when the snow
      will go either. You haven&rsquo;t answered my question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to whether anyone has been browsing on your range?&rdquo;
      exclaimed Roderick. &ldquo;I must confess I do not know. They have had
      dances and parties and all that sort of thing but&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t
      know, I have not felt in the mood and declined to attend. How do you find
      the little queen of your heart? Has she forgotten you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; responded Grant, slowly. &ldquo;But dam it all, I can&rsquo;t
      talk very well before the whole family. I am an out-door man. You give me
      the hills as a background and those millions of wild flowers that color
      our valleys along in July like Joseph&rsquo;s coat, and it makes me bubble
      over with poetry and I can talk to beat a phonograph monologist.&rdquo;
      This was said in a jovial, joking tone, but beneath it all Roderick knew
      there was much serious truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it, Grant? Are you pretty badly hit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right square between the eyes, old man. Why, do you know, sitting
      over in that rocky gorge of Dillon canyon in the little town of Dillon,
      writing editorials for the Double jack month after month and no one to
      read my paper, I have had time to think it all over, and I have made up my
      mind to come here to the Shields ranch and tell Dorothy it is my firm
      conviction that she is the greatest woman on top of the earth, and that
      life to me without her is simply&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t have words to
      describe the pitiful loneliness of it all without her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick leaned back in his chair and laughed hilariously at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no joking matter,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
      goner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there came a knock at the door and Roderick hastily arose to bid
      welcome to the caller. To the surprise of both the visitor proved to be
      Major Buell Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton exchanged cordial greetings and expressed his great pleasure
      at finding his two young friends together. Accepting the invitation to be
      seated, he drew his meerschaum from his pocket and proceeded to fill from
      a tobacco pouch made of deer skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Jones and&rsquo; Mr. Warfield,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;where
      have you been all through the winter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself, right here doing chores about twelve hours per day,&rdquo;
      answered Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;I have been way over &lsquo;yonder&rsquo;
      editing the <i>Dillon Doublejack.</i> I have fully a score of subscribers
      who would have been heartbroken if I had missed a single issue. I
      snow-shoed in to Encampment once, but your castle was locked and nobody
      seemed to know where you had gone, Major.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones had again laughed good-naturedly over the limited circulation of his
      paper. Major Hampton smiled, while Roderick observed that there was
      nothing like living in a literary atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your circulation is small your persistence is certainly
      commendable,&rdquo; observed the Major, looking benignly at Jones but not
      offering to explain his absence from Encampment when Jones had called.
      &ldquo;I have just paid my respects,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to Mr. and
      Mrs. Shields and their lovely daughters, and learned that you were also
      visiting these hospitable people. My errand contemplated calling upon Mr.
      Warfield as well. I almost feel I have been neglected. The latchstring
      hangs on the outside of my door for Mr. War-field as well as for you, Mr.
      Jones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; observed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your compliment is not unappreciated,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;When
      do you return to Encampment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately after luncheon,&rdquo; replied the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will go along with you,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;I
      came over on my skis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a pleasure for me to extend the hospitality of the
      comfortable riding sled that brought me over,&rdquo; responded the Major
      with Chesterfieldian politeness. &ldquo;Jim Rankin is one of the safest
      drivers in the country and he has a fine spirited team, while the sledding
      is simply magnificent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although the jingle of sleigh-bells always makes me homesick,&rdquo;
      remarked Roderick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel mighty pleased to return with
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be your own fault, Mr. Warfield, if you do not accompany
      us. I have just been talking to Mr. Shields, and he says you are the most
      remarkable individual he has ever had on his ranch&mdash;a regular hermit
      They never see you up at the house, and you have not been away from the
      ranch for months, while the young ladies, Miss Barbara and Miss Dorothy,
      think it perfectly horrid&mdash;to use their own expression&mdash;that you
      never leave your quarters here or spend an evening with the family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick,&rdquo; observed Grant, &ldquo;I never thought you were a
      stuck-up prig before, but now I know you for what you are. But there must
      be an end to such exclusiveness. Let someone else do the chores. Get ready
      and come on back to Encampment with us, and we&rsquo;ll have a royal
      evening together at the Major&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent idea,&rdquo; responded the Major. &ldquo;I have some
      great secrets to impart&mdash;but I am not sure I will tell you one of
      them,&rdquo; he added with a good-natured smile. The others laughed at his
      excess of caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;if Mr. Shields can spare me
      for a few days I&rsquo;ll accept your invitation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door was opened unceremoniously and in walked the two
      Miss Shields. The men hastily arose and laid aside their pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are here as messengers,&rdquo; said Miss Dorothy, smiling.
      &ldquo;You, Mr. Warfield, are to come up to the house and have dinner with
      us as well as the Major and Grant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glorious,&rdquo; said Grant, smiling broadly. &ldquo;Roderick, did
      you hear that? She calls you Mr. Warfield and she calls me Grant.
      Splendid, splendid!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know somebody that will have their ears cuffed in a moment,&rdquo;
      observed Miss Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I ejaculate splendid!&rdquo; said Grant in great hilarity, as
      if daring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a mystery to me,&rdquo; observed the Major, &ldquo;how two
      such charming young ladies can remain so unappreciated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Major,&rdquo; protested Barbara, &ldquo;we are not
      unappreciated. Everybody thinks we are just fine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; observed Grant with great solemnity, &ldquo;this is
      an opportunity I have long wanted.&rdquo; He cleared his throat, winked at
      Roderick, made a sweeping glance at the young ladies and observed: &ldquo;I
      wanted to express my admiration, yes, I might say my affection for&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy&rsquo;s face was growing pink. She divined Grant&rsquo;s ardent
      feelings although he had spoken not one word of love to her. Lightly
      springing to his side, she playfully but firmly placed her hands over his
      mouth and turned whatever else he had to say into incoherency.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ended Grant&rsquo;s declaration. Even Major Buell Hampton smiled and
      Roderick inquired: &ldquo;Grant, what are you mumbling about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy dropped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just trying to tell her to keep me muzzled forever,&rdquo;
      Grant smiled, and Dorothy&rsquo;s cheeks were red with blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this final sally all started for the big ranch house where they found
      that a sumptuous meal had been prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the repast Barbara learned of the proposed reunion of the three
      friends at Encampment, and insisted that her father should give a few days&rsquo;
      vacation to Mr. Warfield. The favor was quickly granted, and an hour later
      Jim Rankin brought up his bob-sled and prancing team, and to the merry
      sound of the sleigh-bells Major Buell Hampton and the two young men sped
      away for Encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that Roderick and Grant should have an hour or two to
      themselves and then call later in the evening on the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was half irritated to find no letter at the post office from
      Stella Rain. In point of fact, during the past two months, he had been
      noticing longer and longer gaps in her correspondence. Sometimes he felt
      his vanity touched and was inclined to be either angry or humiliated. But
      at other times he just vaguely wondered whether his loved one was drifting
      away from him.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE MAJOR&rsquo;S FIND
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Grant Jones
      and Roderick arrived at the Major&rsquo;s home that evening they found
      other visitors already installed before the cheerful blaze of the open
      hearth. These were Tom Sun, owner of more sheep than any other man in the
      state; Boney Earnest, the blast furnace man in the big smelting plant; and
      Jim Rankin, who had joined his two old cronies after unharnessing the
      horses from the sleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cordial introductions and greetings were exchanged. Although Roderick had
      shaken hands before with Boney Earnest, this was their first meeting in a
      social way. And it was the very first time he had encountered Tom Sun.
      Therefore the fortuitous gathering of his father&rsquo;s three old friends
      came to him as a pleasant surprise. He was glad of the chance to get
      better acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the company were settling themselves in chairs around the fireplace,
      Jim Rankin seized the moment for a private confabulation with Roderick. He
      drew the young man into a corner and addressed him in a mysterious
      whisper: &ldquo;By gunnies, Mr. War-field, it sure is powerful good to
      have yer back agin. It&rsquo;s seemed a tarnation long winter. But you bet
      I&rsquo;ve been keepin&rsquo; my mind on things&mdash;our big secret&mdash;you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick nodded and Rankin went on: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been prognosticatin&rsquo;
      out this here way and then that way on a dozen trips after our
      onderstandin&rsquo;, searchin&rsquo; like fur that business; but dang my
      buttons it&rsquo;s pesterin&rsquo; hard to locate and don&rsquo;t you
      forgit it. Excuse us, gentlemen, we are talkin&rsquo; about certain
      private matters but we don&rsquo;t mean ter be impolite. I&rsquo;m &lsquo;lowin&rsquo;
      it&rsquo;s the biggest secret in these diggin&rsquo;s&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
      that right, Roderick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rankin laughed good-humoredly at his own remarks as he took out his
      tobacco pouch of fine cut and stowed away a huge cud. &ldquo;You bet yer
      life,&rdquo; he continued between vigorous chews, &ldquo;somebody is
      nachurlly going to be a heap flustrated &lsquo;round here one of these
      days, leastways that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re assoomin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Jim,&rdquo; observed Tom Sun, &ldquo;what are you talkin&rsquo;
      about anyway? Boney, I think Jim is just as crazy as ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s no lie,&rdquo; responded Boney,
      good-naturedly. &ldquo;Always was as crazy as a March hare with a bone in
      its throat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here you fellows, yer gittin&rsquo; tumultuous,&rdquo;
      exclaimed Rankin, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re interferin&rsquo;. Say, Major
      Hampton, I&rsquo;m not a dangnation bit peevish or nuthin&rsquo; like
      that, but do you know who are the four biggest and most ponderous liars in
      the state of Wyoming?&rdquo; The Major looked up in surprise but did not
      reply. &ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; said Rankin, expectorating toward the burning
      logs in the open hearth and proceeding to answer his own question, &ldquo;Boney
      Earnest is sure one uv &lsquo;em, I am one uv &lsquo;em, and Tom Sun is
      &lsquo;tother two.&rdquo; Rankin guffawed loudly. This brought forth quite
      an expression of merriment The only reply from Tom Sun was that his thirty
      odd years of association with Jim Rankin and Boney Earnest was quite
      enough to make a prince of liars of anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the Major said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, after taking a strict
      inventory I find there are six men in the world for whom I entertain an
      especial interest. Of course, my mission in life in a general way is in
      behalf of humanity, but there are six who have come to be closer to me
      than all the rest Five of them are before me. Of the other I will not
      speak at this time. I invited you here this evening because you represent
      in a large measure the things that I stand for. The snow will soon be
      going, spring is approaching and great things will happen during the next
      year&mdash;far greater than you dream of. You are friends of mine and I
      have decided under certain restrictions to share with you an important
      secret.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he pointed to some little sacks, until now unnoticed, that lay
      on the center table. &ldquo;Untie these sacks and empty the contents onto
      the table if you will, Mr. Warfield.&rdquo; Roderick complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each sack held about a hatful of broken rock, and to the amazement of the
      Major&rsquo;s guests Roderick emptied out on the table the richest gold
      ores that any of them had ever beheld. They were porphyry and white
      quartz, shot full of pure gold and stringers of gold. Indeed the pieces of
      quartz were seemingly held together with purest wire gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural query that was in the heart of everyone was soon given voice
      by Jim Rankin. After scanning the remarkable exhibit he turned to Major
      Buell Hampton and exclaimed: &ldquo;Gosh &lsquo;lmighty, Major, where did
      this here come from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most natural question but one which I am not inclined to answer
      at this time,&rdquo; said the Major, smiling benignly. &ldquo;Gentlemen,
      it is my intention that everyone present shall share with me in a
      substantial way in the remarkable discovery, the evidence of which is
      lying before you. There are five of you and I enjoin upon each the most
      solemn pledge of secrecy, even as regards the little you have yet learned
      of the great secret which I possess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They all gave their pledges, and the Major went on: &ldquo;There is enough
      of these remarkably rich ores for everyone. But should the slightest
      evidence come to me that anyone of you gentlemen has been so thoughtless,
      or held the pledge you have just made so lightly, that you have shared
      with any outsider the information so far given, his name will assuredly be
      eliminated from this pact. Therefore, it is not only a question of honor
      but a question of self-interest, and I feel sure the former carries with
      it more potency with each of you than the latter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Roderick was closely examining the samples of gold.
      Instinctively he had put his hand to the inside pocket of his coat and
      felt for his father&rsquo;s map. He was wondering whether Buell Hampton
      had come into possession of the identical piece of knowledge he himself
      was searching for. Presently Jim Rankin whispered in his ear: &ldquo;By
      gunnies, Warfield, I guess the Major has beat us to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roderick shook his head reassuringly. He remembered that his father&rsquo;s
      find was placer gold&mdash;water-worn nuggets taken from a sandbar in some
      old channel, as the sample in Jim Rankin&rsquo;s own possession showed.
      The ores he was now holding were of quite a different class&mdash;they had
      been broken from the living rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the specimens had been returned to the sample sacks and the
      excitement had quieted a little, Major Hampton threw his head back in his
      own princely way, as he sat in his easy chair before the fire and
      observed: &ldquo;Money may be a blessing or it may be a curse. Personally
      I shall regret the discovery if a single dollar of this wealth, which it
      is in my power to bring to the light of day, should ever bring sorrow to
      humanity. It is my opinion that the richest man in the world should not
      possess more than a quarter of a million dollars at most, and even that
      amount is liable to make a very poor citizen out of an otherwise good man.
      Unnecessary wealth merely stimulates to abnormal or wicked extravagance.
      It is also self-evident that a more equal distribution of wealth would
      obtain if millionaires were unknown, and greater happiness would naturally
      follow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the world requires &lsquo;spenders&rsquo; as well as
      getters,&rsquo;&rdquo;laughed Tom Sun. &ldquo;Otherwise we would all be
      dying of sheer weariness of each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, there are arguments on both sides,&rdquo; assented the
      Major. &ldquo;It is a difficult problem. I was merely contending that a
      community of comparatively poor people who earn their bread by the sweat
      of their brow&mdash;tilling the soil and possessed of high ideals of good
      citizenship&mdash;such people beyond question afford the greatest example
      of contentment, morality and happiness. Great wealth is the cause of some
      of our worst types of degeneracy. However,&rdquo; he concluded, knocking
      the ashes from his pipe, &ldquo;it is not my purpose this evening to
      sermonize. Nor do I intend at present to say anything more about the rich
      gold discovery I have made except to reiterate my assurance that at the
      proper time all you gentlemen will be called on to share in the enterprise
      and in its profits. Now I believe some of you&rdquo;&mdash;and he looked
      at Jim Rankin, Tom Sun and Boney Earnest as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;have
      another engagement tonight. It was only at my special request, Mr.
      Warfield, that they remained to meet you and Mr. Jones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re much obliged to you, Major,&rdquo; said Boney
      Earnest, arising and glancing at his watch. &ldquo;Hope old John Warfield&rsquo;s
      boy and I will get still better acquainted. But I&rsquo;ve got to be going
      now. You see my wife insisted that I bring the folks back early so that
      she might have a visit with Mr. Rankin and Mr. Sun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Sun shook hands cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to have met you, Mr. Warfield,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for your
      father&rsquo;s sake as well as your own. I trust we&rsquo;ll meet often.
      Good-night, Mr. Jones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rankin whispered something to Roderick, but Roderick did not catch the
      words, and when he attempted to inquire the old fellow merely nodded his
      head and said aloud: &ldquo;You bet your life; I&rsquo;m assoomin&rsquo;
      this is jist &lsquo;tween me and you.&rdquo; Roderick smiled at this
      oddity, as the man of mystery followed his friends from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed and Roderick and Grant were alone with the Major,
      pipes were again lighted, and a spell of silence fell upon the group&mdash;the
      enjoyable silence of quiet companionship. The Major showed no disposition
      to re-open the subject of the rich gold discovery, nor did Roderick feel
      inclined to press for further information. As he mused, however, he became
      more firmly convinced than before that his secret was still his own&mdash;that
      Buell Hampton, in this rugged mountain region with its many undiscovered
      storehouses of wealth, had tumbled on a different gold-bearing spot to
      that located by Uncle Allen Miller and his father. Some day, perhaps, he
      would show the Major the letter and the map. But to do this now might seem
      like begging the favor of further confidences, so until these were
      volunteered Roderick must pursue his own lonesome trail. The mere sight of
      the gold, however, had quickened his pulse beats. To resume the humdrum
      life at the ranch seemed intolerable. He longed to be out on the hills
      with his favorite pony Badger, searching every nook and corner for the
      hidden treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Buell Hampton arose and laid his pipe aside, and going to a
      curtained corner of the room returned with his violin. And long into the
      night, with only a fitful light from the burning logs in the open
      fireplace, the Major played for his young friends. It seemed his
      repertoire was without beginning and without end. As he played his moods
      underwent many changes. Now he was gay and happy, at another moment sad
      and wistful. He passed from sweet low measures into wild, thrilling
      abandonment. Now he was drawing divine harmony from the strings by dainty
      caresses, again he was almost brutally compelling them to render forth the
      fierce passion of music that was surging in his own soul. The performance
      held the listeners spellbound&mdash;left them for the moment speechless
      when at last the player dropped into a chair. The instrument was laid
      across his knees; he was still fondling it with gentle touches and taps
      from his long slender fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love your violin, Major,&rdquo; Roderick at last managed to
      articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the low-spoken fervent reply, &ldquo;every crease,
      crevice and string of the dear old Cremona that was given me more than
      half a century ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;that I could express my
      appreciation of the wonderful entertainment you have given us tonight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very complimentary,&rdquo; replied the Major, bestirring
      himself. He rose, laid the violin on the table, and brightened up the fire
      with additional fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid we must be going,&rdquo; added Grant. &ldquo;It
      is getting late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have a message for you young gentlemen,&rdquo; said the
      Major. &ldquo;You are invited to attend one of the most distinguished
      soirees ever given in the Platte River Valley. Mr. and Mrs. Shields
      mentioned this today, and made me the special messenger to extend the
      invitation to you both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; exclaimed Grant. &ldquo;When does this come off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two weeks from this evening,&rdquo; replied the Major. &ldquo;And
      we will have a comparative newcomer to the valley to grace the occasion.
      She has been here through the late fall and winter, but has been too busy
      nursing her sick and bereaved old father to go out into society.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Holden&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo; queried Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same. And Gail Holden is certainly a most beautiful young lady.
      Have you seen her, Mr. War-field?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m aware of,&rdquo; replied Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most noble young woman, too,&rdquo; continued the Major. &ldquo;They
      are Illinois people. The mother died last year under sad circumstances&mdash;all
      the family fortune swept away. But the girl chanced to own these Wyoming
      acres in her own right, so she brought her father here, and has started a
      little cattle ranch, going in for pedigreed dairy stock and likely to do
      well too, make no mistake. You should just see her swing a lariat,&rdquo;
      the speaker added with a ring of admiration in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick started. Great Scott! could this be the fair horsewoman he had
      encountered on the mountain side just before the coming of the big snow.
      But a vigorous slap on his shoulder administered by Grant broke him from
      reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say something, old fellow? Isn&rsquo;t this
      glorious news? Are you not delighted at the opportunity of tripping the
      light fantastic toe with a beauty from Illinois as well as our own
      home-grown Wyoming belles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Roderick slowly, &ldquo;I have not been
      attending any of these affairs, although I may do so in this instance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Barbara Shields,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;especially
      requested me to tell you, Mr. Warfield, that she positively insists on
      your being present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; laughed Grant. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve made a hit in
      that quarter, eh, Roderick? Well, better a prospective brother-in-law than
      a dangerous rival. Dorothy&rsquo;s mine, and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant&rsquo;s boyish hilarity was contagious, his gay audacity amusing.
      Even the Major laughed heartily. But Roderick was blushing furiously. A
      moment before he had been thinking of one fair charmer. And now here was
      another being thrown at him, so to speak, although in jest and not in
      earnest. Barbara Shields&mdash;he had never dared to think of her as
      within his reach even had not loyalty bound his affections elsewhere. But
      the complications seemed certainly to be thickening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, old chap,&rdquo; said Grant, as they gained the
      roadway. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a look through the town, just to see if
      there&rsquo;s any news about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Bazaar was a
      popular resort. The proprietor was known as &ldquo;Southpaw.&rdquo;
      Doubtless he had another name but it was not known in the mining camp.
      Even his bank account was carried in the name of &ldquo;Southpaw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Roderick and Grant entered the saloon they found a motley crowd at
      the bar and in the gaming room, fully twenty cowboys with their
      broad-rimmed sombreros, wearing hairy chaps, decorated with fancy belts
      and red handkerchiefs carelessly tied about their necks. Evidently one of
      them had just won at the wheel and they were celebrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant lights and the commingling of half a hundred miners and many
      cowboys presented a spectacular appearance that was both novel and
      interesting. Just behind them came shuffling into the room a short, stout,
      heavily-built man with a scowling face covered with a short growth of
      black whiskers. His eyes were small and squinty, his forehead low and his
      chin protruding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick and Grant were standing at the end of the bar, waiting for
      lemonades they had ordered. Roderick&rsquo;s attention was attracted by
      the uncouth newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grant, who is that gorilla-looking chap?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant half turned with a sweeping glance and then looking back at
      Roderick, replied: &ldquo;That is Bud Bledsoe. He is a sort of sleuth for
      Grady, the manager of the smelting plant, the man I introduced you to,
      remember, the first day you came to Encampment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember Grady all right,&rdquo; nodded Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, many people believe he keeps Bledsoe around him to do his
      dirty work. A while ago there was a grave suspicion that this chap
      committed a terrible crime, doubtless inspired by Grady, but it is not
      known positively and of course Grady is all-powerful and nothing was said
      about it outright.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Bud Bledsoe walked into the back part of the room, and
      finding a vacant seat at a gaming table bought a stack of chips and was
      soon busy over his cards. Presently the two friends, having lighted fresh
      cigars, left the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant looked into two or three other places, but finding there was &ldquo;nothing
      doing,&rdquo; no news of any kind stirring, at last turned for home.
      Entering the familiar old bachelor shack, Roderick too felt at home, and
      it was not long before a cheerful fire was kindled and going. Grant was
      leaning an elbow on the mantel above and talking to Roderick of the
      pleasure he anticipated at the coming dance over at the Shields place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what Miss Barbara meant when she sent that special message
      to you, Roderick? Have you a ground wire of some kind with the young lady
      and are you on more intimate relations than I have been led to believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant smiled broadly at Roderick as he asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;I have never spoken to
      her excepting in the presence of other people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you know,&rdquo; Grant went on, &ldquo;that she is the
      object of Carlisle&rsquo;s affections and he gets awfully jealous if
      anyone pays court to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s Carlisle?&rdquo; asked Roderick, looking up
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is the great lawyer,&rdquo; replied Grant &ldquo;W. Henry
      Carlisle. Have you never heard of the feud between Carlisle and Attorney
      Bragdon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;Both names are new to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I supposed everybody knew about their forensic battles. You
      see, W. Henry Carlisle is the attorney for the Smelter and Ben Bragdon is
      without doubt the most eloquent young lawyer that ever stood before a jury
      in southern Wyoming. These two fellows are usually against each other in
      all big lawsuits in these parts of the country, and you should see the
      courthouse fill up when there is a jury trial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick did not seem especially interested, and throwing his cigar stub
      into the open fire, he filled his pipe. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll have a real
      smoke,&rdquo; he observed as he pressed a glowing firestick from the
      hearth down on the tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grady and Carlisle are together in all financial ventures,&rdquo;
      Grant continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look as if you are very fond of this man Grady,&rdquo;
      commented Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fond of him?&rdquo; ejaculated Grant in disgust; &ldquo;he is the
      most obnoxious creature in the district. He treats everybody who is
      working for him as if they were dogs. He has this bruiser, Bud Bledsoe, as
      a sort of bodyguard and this W. Henry Carlisle as a legal protector, so he
      attempts to walk rough shod over everybody&mdash;indifferent and insolent.
      Oh, let&rsquo;s not talk about Grady. I become indecently indignant
      whenever I think of his outrages against some of the poor fellows in this
      camp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Roderick, jovially looking up; &ldquo;let us
      talk about the dance and especially Miss Dorothy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the text,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;Dorothy&mdash;Dorothy
      Shields-Jones. Won&rsquo;t that make a corker of a name though? If I tell
      you a secret will you promise it shall be sacred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Grant, reddening, &ldquo;while I was over there
      at the <i>Dillon Doublejack</i> office, isolated from the world,
      surrounded with mountains and snow&mdash;nothing but snow and snowbanks
      and high mountains in every direction, why, I played job printer and set
      up some cards with a name thereon&mdash;can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said Roderick, smiling broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Dorothy Shields-Jones,&rdquo; he repeated slowly, then
      laughed uproariously at the confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see one of the cards,&rdquo; asked Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I only kept the proof I pulled before pieing the type, and
      that I have since torn up. But just wait That girl&rsquo;s destiny is
      marked out for her,&rdquo; continued Grant, enthusiastically, &ldquo;and
      believe me, Warfield, I shall make her life a happy one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ve convinced her of that, old man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Convinced her! Why I haven&rsquo;t had the courage yet to say a
      word,&rdquo; replied Grant, somewhat shamefacedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
      to rely on you to speak up for me when the critical moment arrives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rather premature, certainly, to print the lady&rsquo;s
      double-barreled-name visiting card,&rdquo; laughed Roderick. &ldquo;But
      there, you know I&rsquo;m with you and for you all the time.&rdquo; And he
      extended the hand of brotherly comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about you and Barbara?&rdquo; ventured Grant, tentatively.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard your name mentioned in connection with hers
      several times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, forget all that rot,&rdquo; responded Roderick, flushing
      slightly. He had never mentioned the &ldquo;college widow&rdquo; to his
      friend, and felt that he was sailing under false colors. &ldquo;It will be
      a long time before I can think of such matters,&rdquo; he went on, turning
      toward his accustomed stretcher. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to bed. It has
      been a long day, and I for one am tired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later lights were out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got up next morning, they found that a letter had been pushed
      under the door. Warfield picked it up and read the scrawled inscription.
      It was addressed to Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Grant as he took the letter from Roderick, &ldquo;this
      town is forging ahead mighty fast. Free delivery. Who in the demnition
      bowwows do you suppose could have done this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening the envelope he spread the letter on the table, and both bent
      above it to read its contents. There was just a couple of lines, in
      printed characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words had been cut out of a newspaper apparently, and stuck on the white
      sheet of paper. They read as follows: <i>&ldquo;Tell your friend to let
      Barbara alone or his hide will be shot full of holes.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant and Roderick stood looking at each other, speechless with amazement.
      Barbara was the only written word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be the meaning of this?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond me,&rdquo; replied Grant. &ldquo;Evidently others besides
      myself have come to think you are interested in Barbara Shields. Possibly
      the young lady has been saying nice things about you, and somebody is
      jealous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rank foolishness,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick hotly. Then he laughed,
      as he added: &ldquo;However, if the young lady interested me before she
      becomes all the more interesting now. But let the incident drop. We shall
      see what we shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked up the street to a restaurant and breakfasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; remarked Grant, referring back to the strange
      letter, &ldquo;that Attorney Carlisle, who they say is daffy over Barbara
      Shields, has had that sleuth of Grady&rsquo;s, Bud Bledsoe, fix up this
      letter to sort of scare you off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant laughed good-humoredly as he said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scare me off like hell,&rdquo; said Roderick in disgust. &ldquo;I
      am not easily scared with anonymous letters. Only cowards write that sort
      of stuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They arose from the table and turned down the street towards the smelting
      plant It was necessary to keep well on the sidewalks and away from the mud
      in the roadway, for the weather was turning warm and snow was melting very
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no sleighs and sleigh-bells at the Shields&rsquo;
      entertainment,&rdquo; observed Grant. &ldquo;This snow in the lowlands
      will all be gone in a day or two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They paused on a street corner and noticed five logging outfits swinging
      slowly down the street, then turn into the back yard of Buell Hampton&rsquo;s
      home and begin unloading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose Major Hampton can want with all those logs?&rdquo;
      asked Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us make a morning call on the Major,&rdquo; suggested Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; assented Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major extended his usual hearty welcome. He had evidently been busy at
      his writing table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came down,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;to get a job cutting wood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major looked out of the window at the great stack of logs and smiled.
      &ldquo;No, young gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;those logs are not for
      firewood but to build an addition to my humble home. You see, I have a
      small kitchen curtained off in the rear, and back of that I intend putting
      in an extra room. I expect to have ample use for this additional
      accommodation, but just at this time perhaps will not explain its
      purposes. Won&rsquo;t you be seated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled up chairs before the fire, which was smouldering low, for in
      the moderated condition of the weather a larger fire was not needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for a moment, Major. We do not wish to take you from your
      work, whatever it may be. I will confess,&rdquo; Grant went on, smiling,
      &ldquo;that we were curious to know about the logs, and decided we would
      look in on you and satisfy our curiosity; and then, too, we have the
      pleasure of saying hello.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind of you, very kind, I am sure,&rdquo; responded the Major;
      and turning to Roderick he inquired when he expected to return to the
      Shields ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out this afternoon,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;By
      the way, Major, do you expect to be at the Shields&rsquo; entertainment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is hardly probable. I am very busy and then, too, I am far
      past the years when such functions interest. Nevertheless, I can well
      understand how two young gentlemen like yourselves will thoroughly enjoy
      an entertainment given by such hospitable people as the Shields.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after they took their leave and walked up the street. Grant made
      arrangements to start directly after luncheon for Dillon, where copy had
      to be got ready for the next issue of his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick rode slowly across the valley that afternoon, his mind dwelt
      on the rich gold discovery made by Buell Hampton, and he evolved plans for
      getting promptly to serious prospecting work on his own account. Sometimes
      too he caught himself thinking of the strange girl of the hills who could
      throw a lasso so cleanly and cleverly; he wondered if their paths would
      ever cross again.

      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;THE EVENING PARTY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE night of the
      big fiesta at the Shields ranch had arrived, and the invited guests had
      gathered from far and near. And what a bevy of pretty girls and gay young
      fellows they were! Even the cowboys on this occasion were faultless Beau
      Brummels; chaps, belts, and other frontier regalia were laid aside in
      favor of the starched shirtfront and dress clothes of the fashionable
      East. The entertainment was to consist of dancing and song, with a
      sumptuous supper about the midnight hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick of course was there&mdash;&ldquo;by command&rdquo; of the fair
      daughter of the house, Barbara Shields. At the entrance to the reception
      hall the twin sisters gave him cordial welcome, and gaily rallied him on
      having at last emerged from his anchorite cell. On passing into the
      crowded room, young Warfield had one of the greatest surprises of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Roderick, old scout, how are you anyway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone had slapped him on the shoulder, and on turning round he found
      himself face to face with Whitley Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitley, old man!&rdquo; he gasped in sheer astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed hand-shaking such as only two old college chums can engage
      in after a long separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it all happen?&rdquo; inquired Roderick, when the first
      flush of meeting was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you later,&rdquo; said Whitley. &ldquo;Gee, old man, I ought
      to beat you up for not letting me know all this time where you were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have been so confoundedly busy,&rdquo; was the
      half-apologetic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so have I myself. I am taking a post-graduate course just now
      in being busy. You would never guess what a man of affairs I&rsquo;ve come
      to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly surprise me,&rdquo; laughed Roderick drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m going to take your breath away. Since you&rsquo;ve
      gone, I&rsquo;ve become quite chummy with your Uncle Allen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, siree. I think he took to me first of all in the hope that
      through me he would get news of the lost prodigal&mdash;the son of his
      adoption whose absence he is never tired of deploring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old uncle,&rdquo; murmured Roderick, affectionately and
      regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he takes all the blame to himself for having driven you away
      from home. But here&mdash;let&rsquo;s get into this quiet corner, man. You
      haven&rsquo;t yet heard half my news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two chums were soon installed on a seat conveniently masked&mdash;for
      other purposes, no doubt&mdash;by pot plants and flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s dear Aunt Lois?&rdquo; asked Roderick, as they
      settled themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear Aunt Lois can wait,&rdquo; replied Whitley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right&mdash;don&rsquo;t look a day older since I
      remember her. It is <i>I</i> who am the topic of importance&mdash;<i>I</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he tapped his chest in the fervency of his egoism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, fire away,&rdquo; laughed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitley rambled on: &ldquo;Well, I was just going to tell you how your
      uncle and I have been pulling along together fine. After stopping me in
      the street two or three times to ask me whether I had yet got news of you,
      he ended in offering me a position in the bank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee whizz!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t look so demed superior. Why, man alive. I&rsquo;m a
      born banker&mdash;a born man of affairs! So at least your uncle tells me
      in the intervals of asking after you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve certainly taken my breath away. But how come you
      to be in Encampment, Whitley?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On business, of course&mdash;important business, you bet, or I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have been spared from the office. Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell <i>you</i>&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      a member of the firm, or will be some day, which is all the same thing.
      There&rsquo;s a fellow here, W. B. Grady, wanting a big loan on some
      smelter bonds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the man. But I thought he was rolling in money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just the fellows who are rolling in money who need
      ready money worst,&rdquo; smiled the embryonic banker with a shrewd
      twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a big speculator on the outside,
      make no mistake, even though he may be a staid and stolid business man
      here. Well, he needs hard cash just at present, and the proposed loan came
      the way of our bank. Your uncle jumped at it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Security must be pretty good,&rdquo; laughed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. But there&rsquo;s another reason this time for your uncle&rsquo;s
      financial alacrity. Seems an old friend of his was swindled out of the
      identical block of bonds offered by this same Grady, and your uncle sees a
      possible chance some day of getting them out of his clutches and restoring
      them to where they properly belong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all that&rsquo;s contrary to one of Uncle Allen&rsquo;s most
      cherished principles&mdash;that friendship and business don&rsquo;t mix. I&rsquo;ve
      heard him utter that formula a score of times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, cherished principles or no cherished principles, he seems
      downright determined this time to let friendship play a hand. He tells me&mdash;oh,
      I&rsquo;m quite in his confidence, you see&mdash;that it&rsquo;s a matter
      of personal pride for him to try and win back his fortune for this old
      friend, General Holden&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holden?&mdash;Holden?&rdquo; murmured Roderick. He seemed to have
      heard the name before, but could not for the moment locate its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General Holden. He&rsquo;s ranching up here for the present&mdash;or
      rather his daughter is. They say she&rsquo;s a stunning girl, and my
      lawyer friend Ben Bragdon has promised to introduce me. Oh, though I&rsquo;m
      a man of affairs, old chap, I&rsquo;ve an eye for a pretty girl too, all
      the time. And I&rsquo;m told she&rsquo;s a top-notcher in the beauty line,
      this Gail Holden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gail Holden!&rdquo; Roderick repeated the name out loud, as he
      started erect in his seat. He knew who the father was now&mdash;the
      daughter was no other than the mysterious rider of the range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitley&rsquo;s face wore a quizzical look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! you know her then, old chap?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never met her&mdash;at least I have never been introduced to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good hearing. Then we&rsquo;ll start level tonight. Of
      course I&rsquo;ll cut you out in the long run if she proves to be just my
      style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; smiled Roderick. He had already recovered his
      self-possession. &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t informed me yet how you come
      to know Ben Bragdon, our cleverest young lawyer here, I&rsquo;ve been
      told, and likely enough to get the Republican nomination for state
      senator.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, simple enough. I&rsquo;ve come up to investigate one technical
      point in regard to those smelter bonds. Well, Ben Bragdon, your political
      big gun, happens to be your uncle&rsquo;s legal adviser in Wyoming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which reminds me,&rdquo; interposed Roderick earnestly, &ldquo;that
      you are not to give away my whereabout, Whitley&mdash;just yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bit rough on the old uncle not to tell him where you are&mdash;or
      at least let him know that you are safe and well. He loves you dearly,
      Rod, my boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I love him&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll admit it, I love him dearly,
      and Aunt Lois too. But this is a matter of personal pride, Whitley. You
      spoke a moment ago of Uncle Allen&rsquo;s personal pride. Well, I&rsquo;ve
      got mine too, and that day of my last visit to Keokuk, when he told me
      that not one dollar of his fortune would ever be mine unless I agreed to
      certain abominable conditions he chose to lay down, I on my side resolved
      that I would show him I could win a fortune from the world by my own
      unaided efforts. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do, Whitley;
      make no mistake. I don&rsquo;t want him to butt in and interfere in any
      way. I am going to play this game absolutely alone, and luckily my name
      gives no clue to the lawyer Ben Bragdon or anyone else here of my
      relationship with the rich banker of Keokuk, Allen Miller.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Rod, whatever you say goes. But all the same there can
      be no harm in my relieving your uncle&rsquo;s mind by at least telling him
      that I&rsquo;ve heard from you&mdash;that you are in good health, and all
      that sort of thing. But you bet I won&rsquo;t let out where you are or
      what you are doing. Oh, I&rsquo;ll go up in the old chap&rsquo;s
      estimation by holding on tight to such a secret. To be absolutely
      immovable when it would be a breach of confidence to be otherwise is part
      of a successful young banker&rsquo;s moral make-up, you understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick laughed, his obduracy broken down by the other&rsquo;s gay
      insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old fellow, we&rsquo;ll let it go at that But as to my
      being in Wyoming, remember dead secrecy&rsquo;s the word. Shake hands on
      that; my faith in such a talented and discreet young banker is implicit.
      But now we must join the others or they&rsquo;ll be thinking us rather
      rude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;or the dear girls may be fretting out their hearts on my
      account. A rich young banker from Iowa doesn&rsquo;t blow into Encampment
      every day, you know.&rdquo; And Whitley Adams laughed with all the buoyant
      pride of youth, good looks, good health, and good spirits. &ldquo;Come
      along, dear boy,&rdquo; he went on, linking his hand in Roderick&rsquo;s
      arm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find Lawyer Bragdon, get our introductions, and
      start fair with the beauteous chatelaine of the cattle range.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick had heard about Ben Bragdon from Grant Jones, but had not as yet
      happened to meet the brilliant young attorney who was fast becoming a
      political factor in the state of Wyoming. So it fell to the chance visitor
      to the town, Whitley Adams, to make these two townsmen acquainted. Bragdon
      shook Roderick&rsquo;s hand with all the cordiality and geniality of a
      born &ldquo;mixer&rdquo; and far-seeing politician. But Whitley cut out
      all talk and unblushingly demanded that he and his friend should be
      presented without further delay to General Holden&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found her in company with Barbara Shields who, her duties of
      receiving over, was now mingling with her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Holden, let me present you to Mr. Roderick Warfield.&rdquo;
      The introducer was Ben Bragdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of papa&rsquo;s favorite boys,&rdquo; added Barbara kindly,
      &ldquo;and one of our best riders on the range.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I happen to know,&rdquo; said Gail Holden; and with a frank
      smile of recognition she extended her hand. &ldquo;We have already met in
      the hills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was blushing. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he laughed nervously. &ldquo;I
      was stupid enough to offer to help you with a young steer. But I didn&rsquo;t
      know then I was addressing such a famous horsewoman and expert with the
      lariat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail Holden smiled, pleasedly but composedly. She possessed that peculiar
      modesty of dignified reserve which challenges the respect of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you would have no doubt done a great deal better than I did,&rdquo;
      she replied graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Whitley Adams had administered a kick to Roderick&rsquo;s heel, and
      was now pushing him aside with a muttered: &ldquo;You never told me you
      had this flying start, you cunning dog. But it&rsquo;s my turn now.&rdquo;
      And he placed himself before Miss Holden, and was duly presented by
      Bragdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Whitley was engaging Gail in a sprightly conversation.
      Roderick turned to Barbara, only to find her appropriated by Ben Bragdon.
      And Barbara seemed mightily pleased with the young lawyer&rsquo;s
      attentions&mdash;she was smiling, and her eyes were sparkling, as she
      listened to some anecdote he was telling. Roderick began to feel kind of
      lonesome. If there was going to be anyone &ldquo;shot full of holes&rdquo;
      because of attentions to the fair Miss Barbara, he was evidently not the
      man. He had said to Grant Jones that any association of his name with hers
      was &ldquo;rank foolishness,&rdquo; and humbly felt now the absolute
      truthfulness of the remark. He began to look around for Grant&mdash;he
      felt he was no ladies&rsquo; man, that he was out of his element in such a
      gathering. There were many strange faces; he knew only a few of those
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his roving glance again lighted and lingered on Gail Holden. Yes, she
      was beautiful, indeed, both in features and in figure. Tall, willowy,
      stately, obviously an athlete, with a North of Ireland suggestion in her
      dark fluffy hair and sapphire blue eyes and pink-rose cheeks. He had seen
      her riding the range, a study in brown serge with a big sombrero on her
      head, and he saw her now in the daintiest of evening costumes, a deep
      collar of old lace around her fair rounded neck, a few sprigs of lily of
      the valley in her corsage, a filigree silver buckle at the belt that
      embraced her lissom form. And as he gazed on this beauty of the hills,
      this splendid type of womanhood, there came back to him in memory the
      wistful little face&mdash;yes, by comparison the somewhat worn and faded
      face&mdash;of the &ldquo;college widow&rdquo; to whom his troth was
      plighted, for whom he had been fighting and was fighting now the battle of
      life, the prize of true love he was going to take back proudly to Uncle
      Allen Miller along with the fortune he was to win with his own brain and
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad, it&rsquo;s more than three weeks since Stella wrote to me,&rdquo;
      he said to himself, angrily. Somehow he was glad to feel angry&mdash;relieved
      in mind to find even a meagre pitiful excuse for the disloyal comparison
      that had forced itself upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment the music struck up, there was a general movement, and
      he found himself next to Dorothy Shields. Whitley had already sailed away
      with Miss Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Grant?&rdquo; asked Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet arrived,&rdquo; replied Dorothy. &ldquo;He warned me that
      he would be late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps I may have the privilege of the first waltz, as his
      best friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or for your own sake,&rdquo; she laughed, as she placed her hand on
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they were in the mazy whirl. When the dance was ended Dorothy, taking
      his arm, indicated that she wished him to meet some people in another part
      of the room. After one or two introductions to young ladies, she turned to
      a rather heavy set, affable-looking gentleman and said: &ldquo;Mr.
      Warfield, permit me to introduce you to Mr. Carlisle&mdash;Mr. Carlisle,
      Mr. Warfield.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The men shook hands and looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes. Roderick
      remembered this was the attorney of the smelting plant, and Carlisle
      remembered this was the young gentleman of whom the Shields sisters had so
      often spoken in complimentary terms. W. Henry Carlisle was a man perhaps
      forty years old. He was not only learned in the law, but one could not
      talk with him long without knowing he was purposeful and determined and in
      any sort of a contest worthy of his foeman&rsquo;s steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Roderick danced with Barbara, and when he had handed her over to the
      next claimant on her card was again accosted by Ben Bragdon. He had liked
      the young attorney from the first, and together they retired for a
      cigarette in the smoking room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you were introduced to that fellow Carlisle,&rdquo; began
      Bragdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Roderick, smiling, for he already knew of the
      professional feud between the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me say something to you,&rdquo; Bragdon continued.
      &ldquo;You look to me like a man that is worth while, and I take the
      opportunity of telling you to let him alone. Carlisle is no good. Outside
      of law business and the law courts I would not speak to him if he were the
      last man on earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;you are pronounced in your views
      to say the least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bragdon turned to Roderick and for a moment was silent. Then he asked:
      &ldquo;What are you, a Republican or a Democrat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am a Republican.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake,&rdquo; said Bragdon, and they clasped hands without Roderick
      hardly understanding why. &ldquo;Let me tell you something else,&rdquo;
      Bragdon went on. &ldquo;Carlisle claims to be a Republican but I believe
      he is a Democrat. He don&rsquo;t look like a Republican to me. He looks
      like a regular secessionist Democrat and there is going to be a contest
      this fall for the nomination for state senator. W B. Grady and the whole
      smelting outfit are going to back this man Carlisle and I am going to beat
      him. And say&mdash;old man&mdash;&rdquo; he smiled at Roderick when he
      said this and slapped him on the shoulder familiarly&mdash;&ldquo;I want
      you on my side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Roderick, half embarrassed and hesitatingly,
      &ldquo;I guess I am getting into politics pretty lively among other
      things. I don&rsquo;t see at this moment why I should not be on your side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come and see me at my office over at Encampment and we will
      talk this matter over.&rdquo; And so it was agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then they heard singing, so they threw their cigarettes away and went
      back to the ballroom. A quartet of voices accompanied on the piano by Gail
      Holden were giving a selection from the Bohemian Girl. Whitley Adams was
      hovering near Miss Holden, and insisted on turning the music At the close
      of the number Whitley requested that Mr. Warfield should sing. Everyone
      joined in the invitation; it was a surprise to his western friends that he
      was musical. Reluctantly Roderick complied, and proving himself possessed
      of a splendid baritone voice, delighted everyone by singing &ldquo;Forgotten&rdquo;
      and one or two other old-time melodies. Among many others, Dorothy,
      Barbara, and Grant Jones, who had now put in an appearance, overwhelmed
      him with congratulations. Gail Holden, too, who had been his accompanist,
      quietly but none the less warmly, complimented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Gail herself was prevailed upon to sing. As she resumed her seat at
      the piano, she glanced at Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know &lsquo;The Rosary&rsquo;.&rdquo; she asked in a low
      voice unheard by the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my favorites,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you help me with a second?&rdquo; she added, as she
      spread open the sheet of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be honored,&rdquo; he responded, taking his place by her
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her rich contralto voice swelled forth like the sweeping fullness of a
      distant church organ, and Roderick softly and sweetly blended his tones
      with hers. Under the player&rsquo;s magic touch the piano with its deep
      resonant chords added to the perfect harmony of the two voices. The
      interpretation was wonderful; the listeners were spellbound, and there
      followed an interval of tense stillness after the last whispered notes had
      died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Gail rose and stood before him, she looked into Roderick&rsquo;s eyes.
      Her cheeks were flushed, she was enveloped in the mystery of song, carried
      away by music&rsquo;s subtle power. Roderick too was exalted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superb,&rdquo; he murmured ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to you,&rdquo; she replied in a low voice and with a little
      bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the buzz of congratulations was all around them. During that brief
      moment, even in the crowded ballroom they had been alone&mdash;soul had
      spoken to soul. But now the tension was relaxed. Gail was laughing
      merrily. Whitley Adams was punching Roderick in the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, old man, that&rsquo;s taking another mean advantage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Roderick, recovering his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singing duets like that isn&rsquo;t toeing the line. The start was
      to be a fair one, but you&rsquo;re laps ahead already.&rdquo; Whitley was
      looking with comical dolefulness in the direction of Gail Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I catch your drift,&rdquo; laughed Roderick. &ldquo;Well, you
      brought the trouble on yourself, my boy. It was you who gave me away by
      declaring I could sing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which shows the folly of paying a false compliment,&rdquo; retorted
      Whitley. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m going to get another dance anyhow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a step toward Gail, but Roderick laid a detaining hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just yet; the next is mine.&rdquo; And with audacity that
      amazed himself Roderick advanced to Gail, bowed, and offered his arm. The
      soft strains of a dreamy waltz had just begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word she accepted his invitation, and together they floated away
      among the maze of dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s going some,&rdquo; murmured Whitley, as he
      glanced around in quest of consolation. Dorothy Shields appeared to be
      monopolized by Grant Jones, but the two lawyers, Eragdon and Carlisle,
      were glowering at each other, as if in defiance as to which should carry
      off Barbara. So Whitley solved the problem by sailing in and appropriating
      her for himself. He was happy, she seemed pleased, and the rivals, turning
      away from each other, had the cold consolation that neither had profited
      by the other&rsquo;s momentary hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first few rounds Roderick opened a conversation with his
      partner. He felicitated her upon her playing and singing. She thanked him
      and said: &ldquo;Most heartily can I return the compliment.&rdquo; He
      bowed his acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come to Conchshell ranch and call on my father. He will be
      glad to meet you&mdash;has been an invalid all the winter, but I&rsquo;m
      thankful he is better now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be honored and delighted to make his acquaintance,&rdquo;
      replied Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps we can have some more singing together,&rdquo; she
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will be a great pleasure to me,&rdquo; he interjected
      fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to me,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether listening or speaking there was something infinitely charming
      about Gail Holden. When conversing her beautiful teeth reminded one of a
      cupid&rsquo;s mouth full of pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been some time,&rdquo; explained Roderick, &ldquo;since I
      was over your way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment their eyes met and she mischievously replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Next time, I&rsquo;ll not only sing for you, but if you
      wish I will teach you how to throw the lariat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t presume,&rdquo; replied Roderick banteringly, &ldquo;you
      will guarantee what I might catch even if I turned out to be an expert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; Gail quickly rejoined, &ldquo;rests entirely with your
      own cleverness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then it was announced from the dining room that the tables with the
      evening collation were spread, and as Roderick was about to offer his arm
      to Miss Holden, Barbara came hurriedly up, flushed and saying: &ldquo;Oh,
      Gail, here is Mr. Carlisle who wants to take you to supper. And Mr.
      Warfield, you are to escort me.&rdquo; She smiled triumphantly up into his
      face as she took his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked away together and Barbara was vivaciously talking to him,
      he wondered what it all meant Everybody seemed to be playing at cross
      purposes. Again he thought of the letter of warning pushed under Grant
      Jones&rsquo; door and mentally speculated how it would all end.

      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;BRONCHO-BUSTING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS the morning
      following the big entertainment at the Shields ranch when Roderick and two
      other cowboy companions began the work of breaking some outlaw horses to
      the saddle. The corral where they were confined was a quarter of a mile
      away from the bunk house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones had remained overnight, ostensibly to pay Roderick a visit
      during the succeeding day. He was still sound asleep when Roderick arose
      at an early hour and started for the corral. Whitley Adams had also been
      detained at the ranch house as a guest. He had invited himself to the
      broncho-busting spectacle, and was waiting on the veranda for Roderick as
      the latter strolled by.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unbroken horse may or may not be an outlaw. If he takes kindly to the
      bridle and saddle and, after the first flush of scared excitement is over
      with, settles down and becomes bridle-wise then he is not an outlaw. On
      the other hand when put to the test if he begins to rear up&mdash;thump
      down on his forefeet&mdash;buck and twist like a corkscrew and continues
      jumping sideways and up and down, bucking and rearing until possibly he
      falls over backward, endangering the life of his rider and continues in
      this ungovernable fashion until finally he is given up as unbreakable,
      why, then the horse is an outlaw. He feels that he has conquered man, and
      the next attempt to break him to the saddle will be fraught with still
      greater viciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bull-dogging a wild Texas steer is nothing compared with the skill
      necessary to conquer an outlaw pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all cowboy riders, take to broncho-busting naturally and
      good-naturedly, and they usually find an especial delight in assuring the
      Easterner that they have never found anything that wears hair they cannot
      ride. Of course, this is more or less of a cowboy expression and possibly
      borders on vanity. However, as a class, they are not usually inclined to
      boast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very excellent progress had been made in the work of breaking the bronchos
      to the saddle. It was along about eleven o&rsquo;clock when Roderick had
      just made his last mount upon what seemed to be one of the most docile
      ponies in the corral. He was a three-year-old and had been given the name
      of Firefly. The wranglers or helpers had no sooner loosened the blindfold
      than Roderick realized he was on the hurricane deck of a pony that would
      probably give him trouble. When Firefly felt the weight of Roderick upon
      his back, apparently he was stunned to such an extent that he was filled
      with indecision as to what he should do and began trembling and settling
      as if he might go to his knees. Roderick touched his flank with a sharp
      spur and then, with all the suddenness of a flash of lightning from a
      clear sky, rider and horse became the agitated center of a whirling cloud
      of dust. The horse seemingly would stop just long enough in his corkscrew
      whirls to jump high in the air and light on his forefeet with his head
      nearly on the ground and then with instantaneous quickness rear almost
      upright Whitley Adams was terribly scared at the scene. The struggle
      lasted perhaps a couple of minutes, and then Roderick was whirled over the
      head of the pony and with a shrill neigh Firefly dashed across the corral
      and leaping broke through a six foot fence and galloped away over the open
      prairie. The two wranglers and Whitley hastened to Roderick&rsquo;s side.
      He had been stunned but only temporarily and not seriously injured, as it
      proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said presently as he rubbed
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Whitley inquired. Roderick slowly rose to his
      feet with Whitley&rsquo;s assistance and stretching himself looked about
      as if a bit dazed. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am not hurt
      but that infernal horse has my riding saddle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better learn to ride a rocking horse before trying to ride
      an outlaw, Warfield,&rdquo; said Scotty Meisch, one of the new
      cowpunchers, sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick whirled on him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you on for a contest most
      any day, if you think you are so good and I am so poor as all that,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;Come on, what do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ride in the Frontier Day&rsquo;s celebration that comes on
      in July at our local fair,&rdquo; the cowboy said. &ldquo;Guess if you
      want to ride in a real contest with me you&rsquo;d better enter your name
      and we&rsquo;ll see how long you last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll just do that for once and show you a little
      something about real roughriding,&rdquo; said Roderick; &ldquo;and Firefly
      will be one of the outlaws.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning he limped off towards the bunk house with Whitley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitley was greatly relieved that Roderick, although he had wrenched the
      tendons of his leg, had no broken bones. A couple of other cowboys mounted
      their ponies, and with lariats started off across the prairie to capture
      the outlaw and bring back the saddle. Whitley was assured that they were
      breaking horses all the time and now and then the boys got hold of an
      outlaw but no one was ever very seriously injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the lounging room of the bunk house, they learned that Grant was
      up and dressed. He had evidently gone up to the ranch house and at that
      very moment was doubtless basking in the smiles of Miss Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The college chums, pipes alight, soon got to talking of old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; remarked Whitley between puffs, &ldquo;last
      month I was back at the class reunion at Galesburg and called on Stella
      Rain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick reddened and Whitley went blandly on: &ldquo;Mighty fine girl&mdash;I
      mean Stella. Finest college widow ever. I did not know you were the lucky
      dog, though?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by my being the lucky dog?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were always smitten in that quarter&mdash;everyone knew
      that. And now those tell-tale flushes on your face, together with what
      Stella said, makes it all clear. Congratulations, old man,&rdquo; said
      Whitley, laughing good-naturedly at Roderick&rsquo;s discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their hands met, Roderick said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, old chap,
      whether congratulations are in order or not. She don&rsquo;t write as
      often as she used to. It don&rsquo;t argue very well for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man alive,&rdquo; said Whitley, &ldquo;what do you want with a
      college widow or a battalion of college widows when you are among such
      girls as you have out here? Great Scott, don&rsquo;t you realize that
      these girls are the greatest ever? Grant Jones shows his good sense; he
      seems to have roped Miss Dorothy for sure. At first I thought I had your
      measure last night, when you were talking to Miss Barbara Shields&mdash;for
      the moment I had forgotten about Stella. Then you switched off and cut me
      out with the fair singer. Say, if somebody don&rsquo;t capture Miss Gail
      Holden&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, puffed awhile, then resumed meditatively: &ldquo;Why, old man,
      down in Keokuk Gail Holden wouldn&rsquo;t last a month. Someone would pick
      her up in a jiffy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided,&rdquo; said Roderick, and looked steadily at Whitley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course, provided he could win her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These western girls, I judge,&rdquo; said Roderick slowly&mdash;&ldquo;understand
      I am not speaking from experience&mdash;are pretty hard to win. There is a
      freedom in the very atmosphere of the West that thrills a fellow&rsquo;s
      nerves and suggests the widest sort of independence. And our range girls
      are pronouncedly independent, unless I have them sized up wrong. Tell me,&rdquo;
      he continued, &ldquo;how you feel about Miss Holden?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Whitley, &ldquo;I knew ahead that she was a
      stunning girl, and after that first waltz I felt withered all in a heap.
      But when I saw and heard you singing together at the piano, I realized
      what was bound to come. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t blush so furiously. You&rsquo;ve
      got to forget a certain party down at Galesburg. As for me, I&rsquo;ve got
      to fly at humbler game. Guess I&rsquo;ll have another look around.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed somewhat wistfully, as he rose and knocked the ashes from the
      bowl of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick had not interrupted; he was becoming accustomed to others
      deciding for him his matrimonial affairs. He was musing over the
      complications that seemed to be crowding into his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I retire from the contest,&rdquo; Whitley went on, his
      smile broadening, &ldquo;and I hope you&rsquo;ll recognize the devoted
      loyalty of a friend. But now those Shields girls&mdash;one or other of
      them&mdash;both are equally charming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t cut Grant Jones out,&rdquo; interrupted Roderick
      firmly. &ldquo;Remember, next to yourself, he&rsquo;s my dearest friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, there&rsquo;s Miss Barbara left. Now don&rsquo;t you
      think I would be quite irresistible as compared with either of those
      lawyer fellows?&rdquo; He drew himself up admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might be liable to get your hide shot full of holes,&rdquo;
      replied Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roderick did not explain his enigmatic utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have a lay-down,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and rest
      my stiff bones.&rdquo; He got up; he said nothing to Whitley, but the
      bruised leg pained him considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Whitley gaily. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do
      a little further reconnoitering up at the ranch house. So long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Warfield was glad to be alone. Apart from the pain he was suffering, he
      wanted to think things over. He was not blind to the truth that Gail
      Holden had brought a new interest into his life. Yet he was half saddened
      by the thought that almost a month had gone by without a letter from
      Stella Rain. Then Whitley&rsquo;s coming had brought back memories of
      Uncle Allen, Aunt Lois, and the old days at Keokuk. He was feeling very
      homesick&mdash;utterly tired of the rough cow-punching existence he had
      been leading for over six months.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;THE MYSTERIOUS TOILERS OF THE NIGHT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N A day or two the
      excitement over the great evening party at the Shields ranch had passed
      and the humdrum duties of everyday life had been resumed. Whitley Adams
      had completed his business at Encampment and taken his departure with the
      solemnly renewed promise to Roderick that for the present the latter&rsquo;s
      whereabouts would not be disclosed to the good folks at Keokuk although
      their anxiety as to his safety and good health would be relieved. Grant
      Jones had torn himself away from his beloved to resume his eternal&mdash;and
      as he felt at the moment infernal&mdash;task of getting out the next issue
      of his weekly newspaper. Gail Holden had ridden off over the foothills,
      the Shields sisters had returned to their domestic duties, and all the
      other beauties of the ballroom had scattered far and wide like thistledown
      in a breeze. The cowboys had reverted to chaps and sombreros, dress
      clothes had been stowed away with moth balls to keep them company, and the
      language of superlative politeness had lapsed back into the terser
      vernacular of the stock corral. Roderick was pretty well alone all day in
      the bunk house, nursing the stiff leg that had resulted from the
      broncho-busting episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between embrocations he was doing a little figuring and stock-taking of
      ways and means. During his six months on the ranch most of his salary had
      been saved. The accumulated amount would enable him to clear off one-half
      of his remaining indebtedness in New York and leave him a matter of a
      hundred dollars for some prospecting on his own account during the summer
      months among the hills. But he would stay by his job for yet another month
      or two, because, although the words had been spoken in the heat of the
      moment, he had pledged himself to meet the cowboy Scotty Meisch in the
      riding contest at the Frontier Day&rsquo;s celebration. Yes, he would
      stick to that promise, he mused as he rubbed in the liniment Gail Holden,
      when she had come to bid him good-by and express her condolence over his
      accident, had announced her own intention of entering for the lariat
      throwing competition, but he would never have admitted to himself that the
      chance of meeting her again in such circumstances, the chance of restoring
      his prestige as a broncho-buster before her very eyes, had the slightest
      thing to do with his resolve to delay his start in systematic quest of the
      lost mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Buell Hampton seemed to have withdrawn himself from the world.
      During the two weeks that had intervened between the invitation and the
      dance, he had not called at the ranch. Nor did he come now during the
      weeks that followed, and one evening when Grant Jones paid a visit to the
      Major&rsquo;s home he found the door locked. Grant surveyed with both
      surprise and curiosity the addition that had been made to the building. It
      was a solid structure of logs, showing neither door nor window to the
      outside, and evidently was only reached through the big living room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reported the matter to Roderick, but the latter, his stiff leg now all
      right again, was too busy among the cattle on the ranges to bother about
      other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Buell Hampton all this time had been very active indeed. During the
      winter months he had thought out his plans. Somehow he had come to look
      upon the hidden valley with its storehouse of golden wealth as a sacred
      place not to be trespassed on by the common human drove. Just so soon as
      the melting snows rendered the journey practicable, he had returned all
      alone to the sequestered nook nested in the mountains. He had discovered
      that quite a little herd of deer had found shelter and subsistence there
      during the months of winter. As he came among them, they had shown,
      themselves quite tame and fearless; three or four does had nibbled the
      fresh spring grass almost at his very feet as he had sat on the porphyry
      dyke, enjoying the beautiful scene, alone in his little kingdom, with only
      these gentle creatures and the twittering birds for companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there and then Buell Hampton had resolved that he would not desecrate
      this sanctuary of nature&mdash;that he would not bring in the brutal eager
      throng of gold seekers, changing the lovely little valley into a scene of
      sordid greed and ugliness, its wild flowers crushed underfoot, its
      pellucid stream turned to sludge, its rightful inhabitants, the
      gentle-eyed deer, butchered for riotous gluttony. No, never! He would take
      the rich God-given gift of gold that was his, gratefully and for the
      ulterior purpose of spreading human happiness. But all else he would leave
      undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gold-bearing porphyry dyke stretching across the narrow valley was
      decomposed; it required no drilling nor blasting; its bulk could easily be
      broken by aid of sledge hammer and crowbar. Two or three men working
      steadily for two or three months could remove the entire dyke as it lay
      visible between mountain rock wall and mountain rock wall, and taking the
      assay value of the ore as already ascertained, from this operation alone
      there was wealth for all interested beyond the dreams of avarice. Buell
      Hampton debated the issues all through that afternoon of solitude spent in
      the little canyon. And when he regained his home he had arrived at a fixed
      resolution. He would win the treasure but he would save the valley&mdash;he
      would keep it a hidden valley still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next evening he had Tom Sun, Boney Earnest and Jim Rankin all assembled in
      secret conclave. While the aid of Grant Jones and Roderick Warfield would
      be called in later on, for the present their services would not be
      required. So for the present likewise there would be nothing more said to
      them&mdash;the fewer in the &ldquo;know&rdquo; the safer for all
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that Tom Sun, Jim Rankin and the Major would bring out the
      ore. Jim was to hire a substitute to drive his stage, while Tom Sun would
      temporarily hand over the care of his flocks to his manager and herders.
      Boney Earnest could not leave his work at the smelter&mdash;his duties
      there were so responsible that any sudden withdrawal might have stopped
      operations entirely and so caused the publicity all were anxious to avoid.
      But as he did not go to the plant on Sundays, his active help would be
      available each Saturday night. Thus the plans were laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although Buell Hampton had allied himself with these helpers in his
      work and participants in the spoil, he yet guarded from them the exact
      locality of his find. All this was strictly in accordance with goldmining
      usage among the mountains of Wyoming, so the Major offered no apology for
      his precautions, his associates asked for or expected none. Each man
      agreed that he would go blindfolded to the spot where the rich ore was to
      be broken and packed for removal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus had it come about that, while Buell Hampton seemed to have
      disappeared from the world, all the while he was very busy indeed, and
      great things were in progress. Actual work had commenced some days before
      the dance at the Shields&rsquo; home, and it continued steadily in the
      following routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major, Tom Sun and Jim Rankin passed most of the day sleeping. At
      night after dark, they would sally forth into the hills, mounted on three
      horses with three pack burros. A few miles away from Encampment the Major
      would blindfold his two assistants, and then they would proceed in
      silence. When they arrived near Spirit Falls the horses and burros would
      be tethered and Major Hampton would lead the way down the embankment to
      the river&rsquo;s bank, then turn to the left, while Tom Sun, blindfolded,
      extended one hand on Buell Hampton&rsquo;s shoulder and still behind was
      Jim Rankin with his hand extended on Tom Sun&rsquo;s shoulder. Thus they
      would make their way to a point back of the waterfall, and then some
      considerable distance into the mountain cavern where the blindfolds were
      removed. With an electric torch the Major lighted the way through the
      grotto into the open valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little farther on was the dyke of porphyry, quartz and gold. Here the
      sacks would be filled with the rich ore&mdash;their loads all that each
      man could carry. Footsteps were then retraced with the same precautions as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the ore sacks on the backs of their burros, the night riders would
      climb into their saddles and slowly start out on the return journey, the
      Major driving the burros ahead along a mountain path, while Tom Sun and
      Jim Rankin&rsquo;s horses followed. After they had gone on for a few miles
      Major Hampton would shout back to his assistants to remove the blindfolds,
      and thus they would return to the town of Encampment in the gray dawn of
      morning, unloading their burros at the door of Major Hampton&rsquo;s
      house. Jim Rankin would take charge of the stock and put them in a stable
      and corral he had prepared down near the banks of the Platte River just
      over the hill. Tom Sun would show his early training by preparing a
      breakfast of ham and eggs and steaming coffee while the Major was placing
      the ore in one hundred pound sacks and carrying them back into the
      blockade addition he had built to his home. He would then lock the heavy
      door connecting the storehouse with the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually the breakfast was ready by the time the Major had finished his
      part of the work and Jim Rankin had returned. After the morning meal and a
      smoke, these three mysterious workers of the night would lie down to
      sleep, only to repeat the trip the following evening. Each Saturday night,
      as has been explained, Boney Earnest was added to the party, as well as an
      extra horse and burro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton estimated that each burro was bringing out one hundred
      pounds nightly, or about three hundred pounds every trip for the three
      burros, with an extra hundred pounds on Saturday night. If this ore
      yielded $114.00 per pound, the assay value already paid him, or call it
      $100.00, it meant that he was adding to his storehouse of treasure about
      $220,000.00 as the result of each week&rsquo;s labors. Thus in three
      months&rsquo; time there would be not far short of $3,000,-000.00 worth of
      high grade gold ores accumulated. If reduced to tons this would make
      nearly a full carload when the time came for moving the vast wealth to the
      railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night in the midst of these operations, when Jim Rankin and Tom Sun
      supposed they were on the point of starting on the usual trip into the
      hidden valley, Buell Hampton filled his pipe for an extra smoke and
      invited his two faithful friends to do likewise. &ldquo;We are not going
      tonight,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We will have a rest and hold a conference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Jim Rankin. &ldquo;Speakin&rsquo; wide open like,
      by gunnies, my old bones are gettin&rsquo; to be pretty dangnation sore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad about you,&rdquo; said Tom Sun. &ldquo;Too bad that you
      aren&rsquo;t as young as I am, Jim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young, the devil,&rdquo; returned Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      prognosticatin&rsquo; I have pints about me that&rsquo;d loco you any time
      good and plenty. &lsquo;Sides you know you are seven years older than me.
      Gosh &lsquo;lmighty, Tom, you an&rsquo; me have been together ever since
      we struck this here country mor&rsquo;n forty years ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom laughed and the Major laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that when the carload was ready Jim Rankin was to rig up
      three four-horse teams and Grant Jones and Roderick Warfield would be
      called on to accompany the whole outfit to Walcott, the nearest town on
      the Union Pacific, where a car would be engaged in advance for the
      shipment of the ore to one of the big smelters at Denver. The strictest
      secrecy would be kept even then, for reasons of safety as well as to
      preserve the privacy desired by Buell Hampton. So they would load up the
      wagons at night and start for the railroad about three o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus as they smoked and yawned during their night of rest the three men
      discussed and decided every detail of these future plans.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;A TROUT FISHING EPISODE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR a time Roderick
      had hung back from accepting the invitation to call at the Conchshell
      ranch, as the Holden place was called. In pursuing the acquaintanceship
      with Gail he knew that he was playing with fire&mdash;a delightful game
      but one that might work sad havoc with his future peace of mind. However,
      one day when he had an afternoon off and had ridden into Encampment again
      to be disappointed in finding no letter from Stella, he had felt just the
      necessary touch of irritation toward his fiancée that spurred him on to
      seek some diversion from his thoughts of being badly treated and
      neglected. Certainly, he would call on General Holden&mdash;he did not say
      to himself that he was bent on seeing Gail again, looking into her
      beautiful eyes, hearing her sing, perhaps joining in a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was mounted on his favorite riding horse Badger, a fine bay pony, and
      had followed the road up the North Fork of the Encampment River a number
      of miles. Taking a turn to the left through the timbered country with
      rocky crags towering on either side in loftiest grandeur, he soon reached
      the beautiful plateau where Gail Holden&rsquo;s home was located. The
      little ranch contained some three hundred acres, and cupped inward like a
      saucer, with a mountain stream traversing from the southerly to the
      northerly edge, where the Conchshell canyon gashed through the rim of the
      plateau and permitted the waters to escape and flow onward and away into
      the North Fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick approached the house, which was on a knoll planted with
      splendid firs and pines, he heard Gail singing &ldquo;Robert Adair.&rdquo;
      He dismounted and hitched his horse under the shelter of a wide spreading
      oak. Just as he came up the steps to the broad porch Gail happened to see
      him through one of the windows. She ceased her singing and hastened to
      meet him with friendly greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, Mr. Warfield, thrice welcome, as Papa sometimes says,&rdquo;
      said Gail, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Roderick, gallantly. &ldquo;I was riding in
      this direction and concluded to stop in and accept your kind invitation to
      meet the General.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be delighted to see you, Mr. Warfield, I have told him
      about your singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was making too much of my poor efforts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. You see my father is very fond of music&mdash;never
      played nor sang in his life, but has always taken keen delight in hearing
      good music. And I tell you he is quite a judge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which makes me quite determined then not to sing in his presence,&rdquo;
      laughed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t get out of it now you&rsquo;re here. He won&rsquo;t
      allow it. Nor will I. You won&rsquo;t refuse to sing for me, will you? Or
      with me?&rdquo; she added with a winning smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be hard indeed to refuse,&rdquo; he replied, happy yet
      half-reproaching himself for his very happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddie is walking around the grounds somewhere at present,&rdquo;
      continued Gail. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you step inside and rest, Mr. Warfield?
      He&rsquo;ll turn up presently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this old rustic seat here on the porch looks exceedingly
      comfortable. And I fancy that is your accustomed rocker,&rdquo; he added,
      pointing to a piece of embroidery, with silk and needles, slung over the
      arm of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a regular Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Well,
      I have been stitching all the afternoon, and just broke off my work for a
      song.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you. Can&rsquo;t you be persuaded to continue?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present. We&rsquo;ll wait till Papa comes. And the weather
      is so delightfully warm that I will take my accustomed rocker&mdash;and
      the hint implied as well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she laughed gaily as she dropped into the commodious chair and
      picked up the little square of linen with its half-completed embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick took the rustic seat and gazed admiringly over the cup-shaped
      lands that spread out before him like a scroll, with their background of
      lofty mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a delightful view from here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gail, as she threaded one of her needles with a
      strand of crimson. &ldquo;I know of no other half so beautiful. And it has
      come to be a very haven of peace and happiness. Perhaps you know that my
      father last year lost everything he possessed in the world through an
      unfortunate speculation. But that was nothing&mdash;we lost my dear mother
      then as well. This little ranch of Conchshell was the one thing left that
      we could call our own, and here we found our refuge and our consolation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was speaking very softly, her hands had dropped on her lap, there was
      the glisten of tears in her eyes. Roderick was seeing the daring rider of
      the hills, the acknowledged belle of the ballroom in yet another light,
      and was lost in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sad,&rdquo; he murmured, in conventional commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not sad,&rdquo; she replied brightly, looking up, sunshine
      showing through her tears. &ldquo;Dear mother is at rest after her long
      illness, father has recovered his health in this glorious mountain air,
      and I have gained a serious occupation in life. Oh, I just love this
      miniature cattle range,&rdquo; she went on enthusiastically. &ldquo;Look
      at it&rdquo;&mdash;she swept the landscape with an upraised hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      all my sweet Jerseys and Hainaults dotted over those meadows look like the
      little animals in a Noah&rsquo;s ark we used to play with when children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do indeed,&rdquo; concurred Roderick, with heartily responsive
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to make this dairy stock business pay to beat
      the band,&rdquo; she added, her face fairly aglow. &ldquo;Just give me
      another year or two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly deserve success,&rdquo; affirmed Roderick,
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. But I do try so hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her beautiful face had sweet wistfulness in it now. Roderick was admiring
      its swift expressive changes&mdash;he was saying to himself that he could
      read the soul of this splendidly frank young woman like a book. He felt
      thrilled and exalted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here comes Papa,&rdquo; exclaimed Gail, springing delightedly
      to her feet
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick&rsquo;s spirits dropped like a plummet. At such an interesting
      psychological moment he could have wished the old General far enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a pleasant smile on his face as Gail presented him, genuine
      admiration in the responsive pressure of his hand as he gazed into the
      veteran&rsquo;s handsome countenance and thanked him for his cordial
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to meet you, Mr. Warfield,&rdquo; General Holden was saying.
      &ldquo;My friend Shields has spoken mighty well of you, and Gail here says
      you have the finest baritone voice in all Wyoming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Daddie!&rdquo; cried Gail, in blushing confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to decide for myself. Come right in. We&rsquo;ll
      have a song while Gail makes us a cup of tea. An old soldier&rsquo;s song
      for a start&mdash;she won&rsquo;t be listening, so I can suit myself this
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Roderick to his bewilderment found himself clutched by the arm, and
      being led indoors to the piano like a lamb to the slaughter. Gail had
      disappeared, and he was actually warbling &ldquo;Marching through Georgia,&rdquo;
      aided by a thunderous chorus from the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we go marching through Georgia,&rdquo; echoed Gail, when at the
      close of the song she advanced from the domestic quarters with sprightly
      military step, carrying high aloft a tea tray laden with dainty china and
      gleaming silverware.
    </p>
    <p>
      All laughed heartily, and a delightful afternoon was initiated&mdash;tea
      and cake, solos and duets, intervals of pleasant conversation, a Schubert
      sonata by Gail, and a rendition by Roderick of the Soldiers&rsquo; Chorus
      from Faust that fairly won the old General&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours had sped like a dream, and it was in the sunset glow that
      Roderick, having declined a pressing invitation to stay for dinner, was
      bidding Gail good-by. She had stepped down from the veranda and was
      standing by his horse admiring it and patting its silky coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, you mentioned at the Shields&rsquo; party that you
      expected to go trout fishing, Mr. Warfield. Did you have good luck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick confessed that as yet he had not treated himself to a day&rsquo;s
      sport with the finny tribe. &ldquo;I was thinking about it this very
      morning,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and was wondering if I had not better
      secure a companion&mdash;someone skilled with rod and reel and fly to go
      with me, as I am a novice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; she exclaimed quickly. &ldquo;Would
      be glad to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty kind of you, Miss Holden,&rdquo; replied
      Roderick, half hesitatingly, while a smile played about his handsome face.
      &ldquo;But since you put it that way I would be less than courteous if I
      did not eagerly and enthusiastically accept. When shall we go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You name the day,&rdquo; said Gail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick leaned hastily forward and placing one hand on his heart said
      with finely assumed gallantry: &ldquo;I name the day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know quite well I do not mean that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed gaily, but all the same a little blush had stolen into her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was the fair lady&rsquo;s privilege to name the day,&rdquo;
      said Roderick, mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Gail, soberly, &ldquo;we will go trout
      fishing tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is settled,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;What hour is your
      pleasure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is better,&rdquo; replied Gail, &ldquo;to go early in the
      morning or late in the evening. Personally I prefer the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will be here and saddle Fleetfoot for you, say, at
      seven tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when he was cantering along the roadway toward home that
      Roderick remembered how Barbara Shields had on several occasions invited
      him to go trout fishing with her, but in some way circumstances had always
      intervened to postpone the expedition. In Gail&rsquo;s case, however,
      every obstacle seemed to have been swept aside&mdash;he had never even
      thought of asking Mr. Shields for the morning off. However, that would be
      easily arranged, so he rode on in blissful contentment and happy
      anticipation for the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at the appointed time found him at Conchshell ranch.
      Before he reached the house he discovered Fleetfoot saddled and bridled
      standing at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail came down the walk as he approached and a cheery good-morning was
      followed by their at once mounting their horses and following a roadway
      that led eastward to the South Fork of the Encampment River.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brought your flies, Mr. Warfield?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;I have plenty of flies&mdash;both
      hackle and coachman. These have been specially recommended to me, but as I
      warned you last night I am a novice and don&rsquo;t know much about them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes use the coachman,&rdquo; said Gail, &ldquo;although,
      like yourself, I am not very well up on the entomology of fly fishing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the road led them away from the open valley into a heavy timber that
      crowned the westerly slope of the river. They soon arrived at their
      destination. Dismounting they quickly tethered their horses. Gail
      unfastened her hip boots from back of her saddle, and soon her bifurcated
      bloomer skirts were tucked away in the great rubber boots and duly
      strapped about her slender waist. Roderick was similarly equipped with
      wading boots, and after rods, lines and flies had been carefully adjusted
      they turned to the river. The mountains with their lofty rocky ledges&mdash;the
      swift running waters rippling and gurgling over the rocky bed of the river&mdash;the
      beautiful forests that rose up on either side, of pine and spruce and
      cottonwood, the occasional whistle and whirr of wild birds&mdash;the balmy
      morning air filled life to overflowing for these two disciples of Izaak
      Walton bent upon filling their baskets with brook and rainbow trout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stream is sufficiently wide,&rdquo; observed Gail, &ldquo;so we
      can go downstream together. You go well toward the west bank and I will
      hug the east bank.&rdquo; Roderick laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; asked Gail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was just sorry I am not the east bank.&rdquo; The
      exhilarating mountain air had given him unwonted audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a foolish fellow,&rdquo; said Gail&mdash;&ldquo;at least
      sometimes. Usually I think you are awfully nice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think we had better fish,&rdquo; asked Roderick,
      whimsically, &ldquo;or talk this matter over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail looked very demure and very determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go right on with your fishing and do as I do, Mr. Roderick
      Warfield. Remember, I&rsquo;m the teacher.&rdquo; She stamped her little
      booted foot, and then waded into the water and cast her fly far down
      stream. &ldquo;See how I cast my line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know a whole lot about fishing, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
      Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I ought to. During occasional summer visits to the ranch I
      have fished in these waters ever so many times. You must not talk too
      much,&rdquo; she added in a lower voice. &ldquo;Trout are very alert, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;If fish could hear as well as see
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Never a fish would there be&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      in our baskets.&rdquo; And she laughed softly at this admonition for
      Roderick to fish and cease badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way is the wind?&rdquo; asked Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; replied Gail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;When the wind is from the North
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The skilful fisherman goes not forth,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      quoted Roderick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t that prove I know something about
      fishing&mdash;I mean fly fishing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a much better way to prove your sport-manship,&rdquo;
      insisted Gail. &ldquo;The fish are all around you and your basket is
      hanging empty from your shoulder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebuked and chided,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continued to cast and finally Gail said: &ldquo;I have a Marlow Buzz
      on my hook.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is a species of the Brown Palmer fly. I like them better
      than the hackle although the coachman may be equally as good. Look out!&rdquo;
      she suddenly exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick turned round quickly and saw her line was taut, cutting the water
      sharply to the right and to the left while her rod was bent like a bow.
      She quickly loosened her reel which hummed like a song of happiness while
      her line sliced the waters like a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you have a rainbow,&rdquo; cried Roderick excitedly, but Gail
      paid no attention to his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the trout leaped from the water and fell back again, then
      attempted to dart away; but the slack of line was not sufficient for the
      captive to break from the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trout finally ceased its fight, and a moment later was lifted safely
      from the water and landed in Gail&rsquo;s net. But even now it continued
      to prove itself a veritable circus performer, giving an exhibition of
      flopping, somersaulting, reversed handsprings&mdash;if a fish could do
      such things&mdash;with astonishing rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; shouted Roderick, as Gail finally released the hook
      and deposited the fish in her basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than a minute later Roderick with all the enthusiasm and zeal
      imaginable was letting out his reel and holding his line taut, for he,
      too, had been rewarded. And soon he had proudly deposited his first catch
      of the day in his fish basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went down the river, over riffles and into deep pools where the
      water came well up above their knees; but, nothing daunted, these
      fishermen kept going until the sun was well up in the eastern sky. At last
      Gail halloed and said: &ldquo;Say, Mr. Warfield, my basket is almost full
      and I am getting hungry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;we will retrace our steps.
      There is a pretty good path along the east bank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many have you?&rdquo; asked Gail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-six,&rdquo; replied Roderick as he scrambled up the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thirty-one,&rdquo; said Gail, enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick approached the bank, and reaching down helped her to a footing on
      the well-beaten path. Then they started up-stream for their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost eleven o&rsquo;clock when they arrived at their point of
      departure and had removed their wading boots. Gail went to her saddle and
      unlashed a little luncheon basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      She utilized a large tree stump for a table, and after it had been covered
      with a napkin and the dainty luncheon of boned chicken, sardines and
      crackers had been set forth, she called to Roderick and asked him to fill
      a pair of silver collapsible drinking cups which she handed to him. He
      went to the brook and returned with the ice-cold mountain vintage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just hungry enough,&rdquo; said Gail, &ldquo;to enjoy this
      luncheon although it is not a very sumptuous repast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick smiled as he took a seat upon the felled tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expect you think you will inveigle me into agreeing with you. But
      not on your life. I would enjoy such a luncheon as this any time, even if
      I were not hungry. But in the present circumstances&mdash;well, I will let
      you pass judgment upon my appetite after we have eaten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As they say on the long army marches in the books,&rdquo; said
      Gail, gaily, &ldquo;I guess we had better fall to.&rdquo; And forthwith
      with much merriment and satisfaction over their morning&rsquo;s catch they
      proceeded to dispose of the comestibles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a little after noon when they reached the Conchshell ranch,
      and soon thereafter Roderick&rsquo;s pony was galloping along the road on
      his homeward way. He had never enjoyed such a morning in all his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;A COUNTRY FAIR ON THE FRONTIER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE was great
      excitement among the bunch of cowboys on the Shields&rsquo; ranch when the
      local newspapers came out with startling headlines and full announcements
      in regard to the annual frontier celebration. That night every line of the
      full page advertisements, also the columns of editorial elaborations on
      the contests and other events, were read aloud to an eager assemblage of
      all hands in front of the bunk house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Dillon Doublejack</i> predicted that this year&rsquo;s celebration
      would undoubtedly afford the greatest Wild West show ever witnessed
      outside of a regular circus display organized as a money-making
      undertaking. Everything was going to be just the real thing&mdash;the
      miners&rsquo; drilling contest, the roping competition, the
      bucking-broncho features, and so on. More than a score of outlaw horses
      that had thrown every cow-puncher who ever attempted to ride them had
      already been engaged. The <i>Doublejack</i> further declared that the
      tournament would be both for glory and for bags of yellow gold, with World&rsquo;s
      Championships to the best rider, to the best bucking broncho buster, to
      the best trick roper, to the fastest cowpony, and to the most daring and
      lucky participant in the bull-dogging of wild steers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the columns of the Encampment <i>Herald</i> special attention was drawn
      to the fact that in the rough riding and outlaw bucking contest for the
      world&rsquo;s championship there was a purse of $1,000 to be divided&mdash;$450
      for first prize, $300 second prize, $150 third prize and $100 fourth
      prize, while in addition Buck Henry, the banker, offered a $200
      championship saddle to the rider who took first place. It was also
      announced that the fair association would pay $50 in cash for every horse
      brought to the grounds that was sufficiently unmanageable to throw every
      rider; each participant to ride any horse and as often as the judges might
      deem necessary to determine the winner; chaps and spurs to be worn by the
      riders, and leather pulling would disqualify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both papers referred to the band concerts as a feature of great interest
      throughout the three days of the fair. Everything was to be decorated in
      colors&mdash;red and green, black and yellow, blue and white, pink and
      scarlet&mdash;from the grandstand down to the peanut boy. The race track
      was fast and in excellent condition, and everything would be in readiness
      at the appointed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each item of news was read out there was a buzz of comment among the
      assembled cowboys, challenges were made, bets freely offered and accepted.
      As the gathering dispersed Roderick Warfield and Scotty Meisch exchanged
      significant glances but spoke no word&mdash;they had been as strangers to
      each other ever since their fierce quarrel on the morning of the
      broncho-busting exercises. Roderick was glad that the day was near at hand
      when the fellow would be made to eat his words. And with the thought also
      came thoughts of Gail Holden. Gee, but it would be fine to see her ride in
      such a contest of nerve and skill!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the eventful morning dawned and the people swarmed into Encampment
      from all the surrounding country. They came from far below Saratoga to the
      north. The entire Platte Valley from as far south as the Colorado state
      line and beyond were on hand. In fact, from all over the state and even
      beyond its confines the whole population moved in to participate in this
      great frontier day celebration. A crowd came over from Steamboat Springs
      and brought with them the famous outlaw horse Steamboat, who had never
      been ridden although he had thrown at least a dozen cowpunchers of highest
      renown.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the programmes were distributed, Firefly was found upon the list of
      outlaw horses, and also to the surprise of many of his friends the name of
      Roderick Warfield appeared as one of the contestants in both the
      bull-dogging and bucking broncho events.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a veritable Mecca of delight for the miners in their drilling
      contests and for the cowboys in their dare-devil riding of outlaw horses&mdash;testing
      their prowess and skill in conquering the seemingly unconquerable. The
      lassoing of fleet-footed and angry cattle, the bull-dogging of wild steers
      gathered up from different parts of the country because of their
      reputation for long horns and viciousness, were spectacles to challenge
      the admiration of the immense throng seated in the grandstand and on the
      bleachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just ten o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the first day when the
      judges sounded the gong and started the series of contests. The first
      event was a cow-pony race, with no restriction as to the sex of the
      riders. Ponies were to be fourteen hands two inches or under. There were
      seven starters. Up in one corner of the grandstand sat Grant Jones
      surrounded by a bevy of beautiful girls. Among them of course was Dorothy
      Shields. All were in a flutter of excitement over the race that was about
      to be run; for Gail Holden was among the contestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail Holden, quiet, unassuming, yet full of determination, looked a
      veritable queen as she sat her pony Fleetfoot clad in soft silk
      shirtwaist, gray divided skirt, and gray soft felt hat. With a tremor of
      delight Roderick noticed that she wore on her sleeve as her colors one of
      his college arm-bands, which he had given her when calling at the
      Conchshell ranch one evening after the trout fishing expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the bell sounded and the word &ldquo;Go&rdquo; was given. A shout
      went up from the grandstand&mdash;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re off&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      off.&rdquo; And away the seven horses dashed&mdash;-four men and three
      lady riders. At the moment of starting Gail had flung her hat to the
      winds. She used no quirt but held her pony free to the right and in the
      open. It was a half-mile track and the race was for one mile. When they
      swept down past the grandstand on the first lap Fleetfoot had gained third
      place. A pandemonium of shouts went up as the friends of each madly yelled
      to the riders to urge their mounts to greater speed. At the far turn it
      was noticed that Fleetfoot was running almost neck and neck with the two
      leaders, and then as they came up the stretch, running low, it seemed as
      if the race would finish in a dead heat between all three ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Gail reached down and was seen to pat her pony upon the neck and
      evidently was talking to him. Fleetfoot leaned forward as if fired with
      fierce determination to comply with her request for still greater effort
      His muscles seemed to be retensioned. He began creeping away inch by inch
      from his adversaries, and amid the plaudits and shouts of the people in
      the grandstand and bleachers, who rose to their feet waving handkerchiefs
      and hats in a frenzy of tumultuous approval, Gail&rsquo;s horse passed
      first under the wire&mdash;winner by a short head, was the judges&rsquo;
      verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second feature was a great drilling contest of the miners from the
      surrounding hills. There were twelve pairs of contestants, and Grant Jones
      became wild with excitement when friends of his from Dillon were awarded
      the championship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus event followed event until the day&rsquo;s program was completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail and Roderick were bidding each other goodnight at the gateway of the
      enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe you my very special thanks,&rdquo; he said as he held her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; she enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For wearing my old college arm-band in the pony race.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Gail, blushing slightly, &ldquo;I had to have
      something to keep my sleeve from coming down too far on my wrist Besides
      they are pretty colors, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roderick was not going to be sidetracked by any such naive
      questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse pointblank,&rdquo; he answered, smiling, &ldquo;to accept
      any excuse for your wearing the badge. I insist it was a compliment to me
      and shall interpret it in no other way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her blush deepened, but she made no further protest. General Holden had
      approached. She turned and took his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until tomorrow then,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, raising his hat to
      both father and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until tomorrow,&rdquo; she quietly responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow brought resumption of the tournament. Gail Holden was to
      display her prowess in throwing the lariat, while Roderick had entered his
      name in the bull-dogging event.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the roping contest Gail was the only lady contestant. The steers were
      given a hundred feet of start, and then the ropers, swinging their
      lariats, started after them in a mad gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail was again mounted on Fleet foot, and if anything ever looked like
      attempting an impossibility it was for this slender girl with her neatly
      gloved little hands, holding a lariat in the right and the reins of the
      pony in her left, to endeavor to conquer and hogtie a three-year-old steer
      on the run. And yet, undismayed she undertook to accomplish this very
      thing. When the word was given she dashed after the fleeing
      three-year-old, and then as if by magic the lariat sprang away from her in
      a graceful curve and fell cleverly over the horns of the steer.
      Immediately Fleetfoot set himself for the shock he well knew was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steer&rsquo;s momentum was so suddenly arrested that it was thrown to
      the ground. Gail sprang from the saddle, and the trained pony as he backed
      away kept the lariat taut. Thus was the steer hogtied by Gail&rsquo;s
      slender hands in 55 3/5 seconds from the time the word was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the lassoers had been more or less successful, but the crowd stood
      up and yelled in wildest enthusiasm, and waved their hats and
      handkerchiefs, as the time for this marvelous feat by Gail was announced
      from the judges&rsquo; stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon the bull-dogging contest was reached, and Grant Jones
      said to those about him: &ldquo;Now get ready for some thrills and
      breathless moments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the word was given a wild long-horned steer came rushing down past
      the grandstand closely followed by a cowboy on his fleet and nimble pony.
      In the corral were perhaps a score of steers and there was a cowboy rider
      ready for each of them. Four or five steers were bull-dogged one after the
      other. Some had been quickly thrown to the ground by the athletic cowboys
      amid the plaudits of the onlookers. But one had proven too strong for the
      skill and quickness of his adversary, and after rather severely injuring
      the intrepid youthful gladiator rushed madly on down the race track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Roderick Warfield came into view astride his favorite pony,
      Badger, riding at full tilt down the race course, chasing a huge
      cream-colored steer with wide-spread horns, cruelly sharp and
      dangerous-looking. As horse and steer came abreast Roderick&rsquo;s
      athletic form swayed in his saddle for a moment, and then like a flash he
      was seen to leap on to the steer&rsquo;s back and reaching forward grab
      the animal&rsquo;s horns. An instant later he had swung his muscular body
      to the ground in front of his sharp homed adversary and brought him to an
      abrupt halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail Holden&rsquo;s face grew pale as she watched the scene from among a
      group of her girl friends on the grandstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the bull-dogging contest is to twist the neck of the steer
      and throw him to the ground. But Roderick accomplished more. The steer
      lifted him once from the ground, and the great throng of people on the
      grandstand and bleachers, also the hundreds who had been unable to obtain
      seating accommodation and were standing along the rails, held their breath
      in bated silence. The powerful cream-colored steer threw his head up, and
      lifting Roderick&rsquo;s feet from their anchorage started on a mad run.
      But when he lowered his head a moment later Roderick&rsquo;s feet caught
      the earth again, and the steer was brought to a standstill. Then the
      milling back and forth began. Roderick&rsquo;s toes sank deep into the
      sand that covered the race track; the muscles of his neck stood out in
      knots. Finally, with one heroic twist on the long horns as a pry over a
      fulcrum, he accomplished the feat of combined strength and endurance, and
      the intense silence of the great throng was broken by a report like the
      shot of a pistol as the bull-dogged steer fell heavily to the earth&mdash;dead.
      The animal&rsquo;s neck was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are very few cases on record where a steer&rsquo;s neck has been
      broken in bull-dogging contests. Roderick therefore had gained a rare
      distinction. But technically he had done too much, for the judges were
      compelled to withhold from him the honors of the championship because in
      killing the animal he had violated the humane laws of the state, which
      they were pledged to observe throughout the series of contests. But this
      did not affect the tumult of applause that acclaimed his victory over the
      huge and vicious-looking steer. Afterwards when his friends gathered
      around him in wonderment at his having entered for such an event he
      confessed that for several weeks he had been practicing bull-dogging out
      on the range, preparing for this contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon of the last day, the finals of the bucking-broncho
      competition were announced from the grandstand. There were only three
      contestants remaining out of the score or more of original entries, and
      Roderick Warfield was among the number. Scotty Meisch was there&mdash;the
      cowboy whom Roderick had challenged&mdash;also Bud Bledsoe, the bodyguard
      and sleuth of W. B. Grady. Three of the unconquered outlaws were brought
      out&mdash;each attended by two wranglers; the names of the horses were put
      in a hat and each cowboy drew for his mount. Roderick Warfield drew Gin
      Fizz, Bud Bledsoe drew Steamboat and Scotty Meisch drew Firefly. And in a
      few moments the wranglers were busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three horses and six wranglers working on them at the same time! It was a
      sight that stirred the blood with expectation. These horses had been
      successful in throwing the riders who had previously attempted to subdue
      them. The outlaws were recognized by the throng even before their names
      were called from the grandstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method of the game is this: One wrangler approaches the horse while
      the other holds taut the lariat that has been thrown over his neck; and if
      the freehanded wrangler is quick enough or lucky enough he seizes the
      horse by the ears and throws his whole weight on the animal&rsquo;s head,
      which is then promptly decorated with a hackamore knotted bridle. A
      hackamore is a sort of a halter, but it is made of the toughest kind of
      rawhide and so tied that a knot presses disastrously against the lower jaw
      of the horse. After being haltered the outlaw is blindfolded with a
      gunnysack. To accomplish all this is a dangerous struggle between horse
      and the wranglers. Then the word &ldquo;Saddle&rdquo; is shouted, and the
      saddles are quickly adjusted to the backs of these untamed denizens of the
      wild. It takes considerable time to accomplish all this and have the
      girths tightened to the satisfaction of the wranglers first and of the
      rider last. Invariably the rider is the court of final resort in
      determining that the outlaw is in readiness to be mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the moments of tense expectancy were ended. It was seen that one
      of the outlaws was ready, and at a call from the judges&rsquo; stand,
      Scotty Meisch the first rough-rider leaped on to the back of his untamed
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Ki-yi&rdquo; yell was given&mdash;the blindfold slipped from
      Firefly&rsquo;s eyes, and the rowels of the rider sunk into the flanks of
      his horse. Bucking and plunging, wheeling and whirling, all the time the
      rider not daring to &ldquo;pull leather&rdquo; and so disqualify himself
      under the rules, the outlaw once again proved himself a veritable demon.
      In just two minutes after the struggle began Scotty Meisch measured his
      length on the ground and Firefly was dashing for the open. The scene had
      been a thrilling one. Roderick noticed that Scotty had to be helped off
      the track, but he felt no concern&mdash;the rough-rider parted from his
      mount in a hurry may be temporarily dazed but is seldom seriously hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steamboat was the next horse. Bud Bledsoe was wont to brag there was
      nothing wore hair that he could not ride. But Steamboat, when he felt the
      weight of a rider on his back, was as usual possessed of a devil. But
      Bledsoe was not the man to conquer the noted outlaw, and down he went in
      prompt and inglorious defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gin Fizz was a magnificent specimen of horseflesh&mdash;black as midnight
      with a coat of hair that shone like velvet. His proud head was held high
      in air. He stood like a statue while blindfolded and Roderick Warfield was
      making ready to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast assemblage in the grandstand held their breath in amazement and
      wondered what would become of the rider of the giant black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Roderick quickly mounted, and men and women rose to their feet to see
      the terribleness of it all. Roderick sent his spurs deep into the flanks
      of the black and plied the quirt in a desperate effort quickly to master
      and subdue the outlaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse reared and plunged with lightning quickness, and at times was
      the center of a whirlwind of dust in his determined zig-zag efforts to
      dislodge his rider. He rose straight up on his hind legs and for a moment
      it looked as if he were going to fall over backwards. Then seemingly
      rising still higher in air from his back feet he leaped forward and
      downward, striking his front feet into the earth as if he would break the
      saddle girth and certainly pitch the rider over his head. He squatted,
      jumped, corkscrewed and sun-fished, leaped forward; then he stopped
      suddenly and in demoniacal anger, as if determined not to be conquered, he
      threw his head far around endeavoring to bite his assailant&rsquo;s legs.
      But at last the horse&rsquo;s exertions wore him down and he seemed to be
      reluctantly realizing that he had found his master. In the end, after a
      terrible fight lasting fully seven minutes, he quieted down in submission,
      and Gin Fizz thus acknowledged Roderick&rsquo;s supremacy. He was subdued.
      Roderick drew rein, patted him kindly, dismounted and turned him over to
      the wranglers. Gin Fizz was no longer an outlaw; he suffered himself to be
      led away, trembling in every limb but submissive as a well-trained
      cow-pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the judges&rsquo; stand, Roderick received a tremendous
      ovation both from the onlookers and from his brother cowboys. The
      championship ribbon was pinned to his breast, and now he was shaking hands
      promiscuously with friends, acquaintances and strangers. But all the while
      his eyes were roaming around in search of Gail Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he was out of the crowd, in a quiet corner, with Grant Jones, the
      Shields sisters, and a few intimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Miss Holden?&rdquo; he enquired of Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she took poor Scotty Meisch to the hospital in an automobile.
      She insisted on going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not badly hurt, is he?&rdquo; he asked drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Just shaken up a lot. He&rsquo;ll be all right in a week&rsquo;s
      time, Dr. Burke says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Gail&mdash;I mean Miss Holden&mdash;didn&rsquo;t see Gin Fizz
      broken?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But she&rsquo;ll hear about it all right,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Barbara enthusiastically. &ldquo;My word, it was great!&rdquo; And she
      shook his hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day of triumph had ended in disappointment for Roderick Warfield.
      He slipped away, saddened and crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all for her I did it&rdquo;&mdash;the thought kept hammering
      at his brain. &ldquo;And she never even stopped to see. I suppose she&rsquo;s
      busy now bathing the forehead of that contemptible little runt in the
      hospital. Stella wouldn&rsquo;t have turned me down like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he found himself thinking affectionately and longingly of the little
      &ldquo;college widow.&rdquo; He hadn&rsquo;t been to the post office for
      three days. The belated letter might have arrived at last. He would go and
      see at all events; and to drown thought he whistled &ldquo;The Merry Widow&rdquo;
      waltz as he grimly stalked along.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;A LETTER FROM THE COLLEGE WIDOW
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ES, there was a
      letter from Stella Rain. Roderick took it eagerly from the hands of the
      clerk at the general delivery window. A good number of people were already
      crowding into the post office from the fair grounds. But he was too hungry
      for news to wait for quieter surroundings. So he turned to a vacant corner
      in the waiting room and ripped open the envelope. The letter was as
      follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Roderick:&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am sure that what I am about to tell you will be for your good
        as well as my own. It seems so long ago since we were betrothed. At that
        time you were only a boy and I freely confess I liked you very, very
        much. I had known you during your four years in college and you were
        always just splendid. But Roderick, a real love affair has come into my
        life&mdash;something different from all other experiences, and when you
        receive this letter I shall be Mrs. Vance Albertrum Carter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mr. Carter, financially, is able to give me a splendid home. He
        is a fine fellow and I know you would like him. Let me be to you the
        same as to the other boys of old Knox&mdash;your friend, the &lsquo;college
        widow.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very sincerely,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stella Rain.&rdquo;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Not a muscle of his face quivered as he read the letter, but at its close
      he dropped both hands to his side in an attitude of utter dejection. The
      blow had fallen so unexpectedly; he felt crushed and grieved, and at the
      same time humiliated. But in an instant he had recovered his outward
      composure. He thrust the letter into his pocket, and shouldered his way
      through the throng at the doorway. He had left Badger in a stall at the
      fair grounds. Thither he bent his steps, taking a side street to avoid the
      crowd streaming into the town. The grandstand and surrounding buildings
      were already deserted. He quickly adjusted saddle and bridle, and threw
      himself on the pony&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She knows I would like him,&rsquo;&rdquo;he muttered, as he
      gained the race track, the scene of his recent triumphs, its turf torn and
      dented with the hoofs of struggling steers and horses, thronged but an
      hour before with a wildly excited multitude but now silent and void.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Like him&rsquo;.&rdquo; he reiterated bitterly. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;like
      hell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with the words he set his steed at the farther rail. Badger skimmed
      over it like a deer and Roderick galloped on across country, making for
      the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he did not return to the bunk house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was high noon next day when he showed up at the ranch. He went straight
      to Mr. Shields&rsquo; office, gave in his resignation, and took his pay
      check. No explanations were required&mdash;Mr. Shields had known for a
      considerable time that Roderick was leaving. He thanked him cordially for
      his past services, congratulated him on his championship honors at the
      frontier celebration, and bade him come to the ranch home at any time as a
      welcome guest. Roderick excused himself from saying good-by for the
      present to the ladies; he was going to stay for a while in Encampment with
      his friend Grant Jones, and would ride out for an evening visit before
      very long. Then he packed his belongings at the bunk house, left word with
      one of the helpers for trunk and valise to be carted into town, and rode
      away. Badger was Roderick&rsquo;s own personal property; he had purchased
      the pony some months before from Mr. Shields, and as he leaped on its back
      after closing the last boundary gate he patted the animal&rsquo;s neck
      fondly and proudly. Badger alone was well worth many months of hard and
      oftentimes distasteful work, a horse at all events could be faithful, he
      and his good little pony would never part&mdash;such was the burden of his
      thoughts as he left the Shields ranch and the cowboy life behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones was in Encampment, and jumped up from his writing table when
      Roderick threw open the door of the shack and walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old man, this is indeed a welcome visit. Where in the wide
      world have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned Roderick around so the light would fall upon his face as he
      extended his hand in warmest welcome, and noticed he was haggard and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;I have been up in the hills
      fighting it out alone, sleeping under the stars and thinking matters over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this all mean, anyway, old man? I don&rsquo;t understand
      you,&rdquo; said Grant with much solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, guess you better forget it then,&rdquo; said Roderick half
      abruptly. &ldquo;But I owe you an apology for going away so
      unceremoniously from the frontier gathering. I know we had arranged to
      dine together last night But I just cleared out&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.
      Please do not ask me any questions, Grant, as to why and wherefore. If in
      the future I should take you into my confidence that will be time enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old man,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;here is my hand. And
      know now and for all time it don&rsquo;t make a derned bit of difference
      what has happened, I am on your side to the finish, whether it is a
      desperate case of petty larceny or only plain murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant laughed and tried to rouse his friend into hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is neither,&rdquo; replied Roderick laconically. &ldquo;All the
      same I&rsquo;ve got some news for you. I have quit my job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Shields ranch?&rdquo; cried Grant in astonishment. &ldquo;Surely
      there&rsquo;s been no trouble there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, we are all the best of friends. I am just tired of
      cow-punching, and have other plans in view. Besides, remember the letter
      we got pushed under the door here on the occasion of my last visit.
      Perhaps I may be a bit skeered about having my hide shot full of holes,
      eh, old man?&rdquo; Roderick was now laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Grant looked grave. He eyed his comrade tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense. The lunatic who wrote that letter was barking
      up the wrong tree. He mistook you for the other fellow. You were never
      seriously smitten in that quarter, now were you, Rod, old man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Barbara Shields is a fine girl, but I never even
      dreamed of making love to her. I didn&rsquo;t come to Wyoming to chase
      after a millionaire&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he added bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Barbara&rsquo;s misfortune not her fault,&rdquo;
      laughed Grant. &ldquo;But I was afraid you had fallen in love with her,
      just as I fell head over heels in love with Dorothy&mdash;for her own
      sake, dear boy, and not for anything that may ever come to her from her
      father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were afraid, do you say?&rdquo; quizzed Roderick. &ldquo;Have
      you Mormonistic tendencies then? Do you grudge a twin to the man you
      always call your best friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know there&rsquo;s no thought like that in my mind,&rdquo;
      protested Grant. &ldquo;But you came on to the field too late. You see Ben
      Bragdon was already almost half engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the other fellow, is it?&rdquo; laughed Roderick.
      &ldquo;Oh, now I begin to understand. Then things have come to a crisis
      between Barbara and Bragdon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is in strict confidence, Rod. But it is true. That&rsquo;s
      why I was a bit nervous just now on your account&mdash;I kind of felt I
      had to break bad news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you worry on my account. Understand once and for
      all that I&rsquo;m not a marrying man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see about that later on,&rdquo; replied Grant,
      smiling. &ldquo;But I should have been real glad had you been the man to
      win Barbara Shields. How jolly happy we would have been, all four
      together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are best just as they are,&rdquo; said Roderick sternly.
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t exchange Badger, my horse out there, for any woman
      in the world. Which reminds me, Grant, that I&rsquo;ve come here to stay
      with you for a while. Guess I can put Badger in the barn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure&mdash;you are always welcome; I don&rsquo;t have to say that.
      But remember that Barbara-Bragdon matter is a dead secret. Dorothy just
      whispered it to me in strictest confidence. Hard lines that, for the
      editor of such an enterprising newspaper as the <i>Dillon Doublejack</i>.
      But the engagement is not to be announced until the Republican nomination
      for state senator is put through. You know, of course, that Ben Bragdon
      has consented to run against Carlisle and the smelter interests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it And now we have an additional reason to
      put our shoulders to the wheel. We&rsquo;ve got to send Ben Bragdon to
      Cheyenne for Barbara&rsquo;s sake. Count me in politics from this day on,
      old man. You see I am out of a job. This will be something worth while&mdash;to
      help down that blood-sucker Grady, and at the same time secure Bragdon&rsquo;s
      election.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Bragdon is the best man for Wyoming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. Put me on his committee right away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a tower of strength,&rdquo; exclaimed Grant
      enthusiastically. &ldquo;The champion broncho-buster of the world&mdash;just
      think of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick laughed loud and long. This special qualification for political
      work mightily amused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; Grant remonstrated, in all
      seriousness. &ldquo;You are a man of note now in the community, make no
      mistake. You can swing the vote of every cow-puncher in the land. You are
      their hero&mdash;their local Teddy Roosevelt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Roderick was convulsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by the way,&rdquo; continued Grant, &ldquo;I never had the
      chance to congratulate you on that magnificent piece of work on Gin Fizz.
      It was the greatest ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll let all that slide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, siree. Wait till you read my column description of the immortal
      combat in the <i>Doublejack.</i>&rdquo; He turned to his writing desk, and
      picked up a kodak print. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your photograph&mdash;snapped
      by Gail Holden on the morning of the event, riding your favorite pony
      Badger. Oh, I&rsquo;ve got all the details; the half-tone has already been
      made. The <i>Encampment Herald</i> boys have been chasing around all day
      for a picture, but I&rsquo;m glad you were in hiding. The <i>Doublejack</i>
      will scoop them proper this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roderick was no longer listening. The name of Gail Holden had sent his
      thoughts far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Scotty Meisch?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;rather
      inconsequentially as the enthusiastic editor thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Scotty Meisch? He&rsquo;s all right. Slight concussion of the
      brain&mdash;will be out of the hospital in about two weeks. But Miss
      Holden, as it turned out, did the lad a mighty good turn in rushing him to
      the hospital He was unconscious when they got there. She knew more than
      Doc Burke&mdash;or saw more; or else the Doc could not deny himself the
      excitement of seeing you tackle Gin Fizz. But there&rsquo;s no selfishness
      in Grail Holden&rsquo;s make-up&mdash;not one little streak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash Roderick Warfield saw everything under a new light, and a great
      glow of happiness stole into his heart. It was not indifference for him
      that had made Gail Holden miss the outlaw contest. What a fool he had been
      to get such a notion into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go and feed Badger,&rdquo; he said, as he turned
      away abruptly and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you come back I&rsquo;ve a lot more to talk about,&rdquo;
      shouted Grant, resuming his seat and making a grab for his lead-pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was several hours before Roderick returned. He had baited the pony,
      watched him feed, and just drowsed away the afternoon among the fragrant
      bales of hay&mdash;drowsing without sleeping, chewing a straw and thinking
      all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he strolled in upon the still busy scribe. Grant threw down his
      pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you had slipped away again to the hills and the starlight
      and all that sort of thing. I&rsquo;m as hungry as a hunter. Let&rsquo;s
      go down town and eat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; assented Roderick. &ldquo;But after
      dinner I want to see Major Buell Hampton. Is he likely to be at home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about Buell Hampton I was going to speak to you. Oh, you don&rsquo;t
      know the news.&rdquo; Grant was hopping around in great excitement,
      changing his jacket, whisking the new coat vigorously. &ldquo;But there, I
      am pledged again to secrecy&mdash;Good God, what a life for a newspaper
      man to lead, bottled up all the time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then when am I to be enlightened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sent for me this morning and I spent an hour with him. He also
      wanted you, but you were not to be found. He wants to see you immediately.
      Tonight will be the very time, for he said he would be at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Grant. But, say, old fellow, I want half an
      hour first with the Major&mdash;all alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mystery after mystery,&rdquo; fairly shouted the distracted editor.
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me at least this last news item for
      publication? I&rsquo;m losing scoops all the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you must go scoopless once again,&rdquo; grinned
      Roderick. &ldquo;But after dinner you can do a little news-hunting on your
      own account around the saloons, then join me later on at the Major&rsquo;s.
      That suit you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose I&rsquo;ve got to submit,&rdquo; replied Grant, as he
      drew on his now well-brushed coat. &ldquo;But all through dinner, I&rsquo;ll
      have you guessing, old man. You cannot imagine the story Buell Hampton&rsquo;s
      going to tell you. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t question me. I&rsquo;m ironclad&mdash;bomb-proof&mdash;as
      silent as a clam.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick laughed at the mixed metaphors, and arm in arm the friends
      started for their favorite restaurant.

      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;THE STORE OF GOLD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> COUPLE of hours
      later Roderick arrived at Buell Hampton&rsquo;s home. The Major was alone;
      there were no signs of Jim Rankin or Tom Sun; no traces of the recent
      midnight toil. The room looked just the same as on the occasion of
      Roderick&rsquo;s last visit, now more than two months ago, except for a
      curtain hanging across one wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton was seated before the great fireplace and notwithstanding
      the season of the year had a small bed of coals burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes the chill away, for one thing,&rdquo; he explained after
      greeting his visitor, &ldquo;and then it gives me the inspiration of real
      live embers into which to look and dream. There are so many poor people in
      the world, so much suffering and so many heartaches, that one hardly knows
      where to begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Major,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;I am glad to find you in
      this mood. I&rsquo;m one of the sufferers&mdash;or at least have been. I
      have come to you for some heartache balm. Oh, I&rsquo;m not jesting.
      Really I came here tonight determined to give you my confidence&mdash;to
      ask your advice as to my future plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am extremely glad you feel toward me like that, my lad,&rdquo;
      exclaimed Buell Hampton, grasping Roderick&rsquo;s arm and looking kindly
      into his eyes. &ldquo;I have always felt some subtle bond of sympathy
      between us. I have wanted to help you at the outset of a promising career
      in every way I can. I count it a privilege to be called in to comfort or
      to counsel, and you will know later that I have something more for you
      than mere words of advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is your advice I want most badly now, Major. In the first
      place I have thrown up my job with Mr. Shields.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired of cow-punching?&rdquo; nodded Buell Hampton with a smile.
      &ldquo;I knew that was coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the second place I want to be perfectly candid with you. I have
      a prospecting venture in view.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I have guessed from several hints you have dropped from time
      to time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you spoke a while ago about your reserving some little
      interest for me in your great gold discovery. That was mighty kind, and
      rest assured I appreciate your goodness to one who only a few months ago
      was a stranger to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that I am a reader of character&mdash;that no kindred
      souls are strangers even at a first meeting, my son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton spoke very softly but very clearly; his gaze rested fixedly
      on Roderick; the latter felt a thrill run through him&mdash;yes,
      assuredly, this great and good man had been his friend from the first
      moment they had clasped hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very good then, Major,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;in
      judging me so kindly. But I am afraid that I evoked your special sympathy
      and interest because of the confidences I gave you at one of our early
      meetings. You will not have forgotten how I spoke in a most sacred way
      about certain matters in Galesburg and what I intended to do when I had
      sufficient money to carry out my plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember distinctly,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Your frank
      confidence greatly pleased me. Well, has anything happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is just one man on earth I will show this letter to, and you,
      Major, are the man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this Roderick handed over Stella Rain&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Major had carefully perused it and put it back in the envelope,
      he reached across to Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give that letter back
      to me. Kindly lay it on the red coals and let me see it burn to gray
      ashes. I have fought this thing out all alone up in the hills, and I am
      now almost glad that letter came, since it had to be. But let it vanish
      now in the flames, just as I am going to put Stella Rain forever out of my
      thoughts. Yesterday the receipt of this letter was an event; but from now
      on I shall endeavor to regard it as only an incident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently and musingly the Major complied with Roderick&rsquo;s request and
      consigned the letter to the glowing embers. When the last trace had
      disappeared, he looked up at Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take one exception to your remarks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do
      not think unkindly of Stella Rain, nor even attempt to put her out of your
      thoughts. Her influence over you has been all for good during the past
      months, and she has shown herself a very fine and noble woman in the
      gentle manner in which she has broken the bonds that had tied you&mdash;bonds
      impulsively and all too lightly assumed on your part, as she knew quite
      well from the beginning. I have a profound admiration for your little
      &lsquo;college widow,&rsquo; Roderick, and hold her in high esteem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was just the suspicion of tears in Roderick&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;a
      lump in his throat which rendered it impossible for him to reply. Yes; all
      bitterness, all sense of humiliation, were now gone. He too was thinking
      mighty kindly of sweet and gentle Stella Rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; continued the Major quietly, &ldquo;you told me
      how she warned you that some other day another girl, the real girl, would
      come along. I guess that has happened now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick started; there was a protesting flush upon his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even though you may not yet fully realize it,&rdquo; quietly added
      the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; faltered Roderick; the flush of offended
      dignity had now turned into the blush of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major smiled benignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my young friend, remember again that I read men&rsquo;s minds
      and hearts just a little. There must be some new influence in your life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that&mdash;how can you say that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton laid a hand on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because otherwise you would be still up among the hills alone,
      young man. Your fight in the wilderness would have lasted for forty days&mdash;not
      for a single night. The fever of love does not die down so suddenly
      without an antidote. The resignation you have shown while we burned that
      letter is not merely a negative condition of mind. There is something
      positive as well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t admit that,&rdquo; protested Roderick. &ldquo;Or
      at least I dare not allow myself to think like that,&rdquo; he corrected
      himself hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see what we shall see. Meanwhile all is well. The
      rich harvest of experience has been reaped; the fertile soil awaits the
      next tillage. The important moment of every life is &lsquo;The Now.&rsquo;
      And this is what we have to think about tonight, Roderick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, Major. And that is just why I opened the conversation.
      As I said at the outset, you assigned me an interest in your gold mine for
      a specific object that no longer exists.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied Buell Hampton, &ldquo;I assigned it
      on general principles&mdash;on the general principle of helping a worthy
      young man at the critical period of starting into useful life-work. But I
      may tell you also,&rdquo; he laughed lightly, &ldquo;that I had in my mind&rsquo;s
      eye valuable and important future services whereby the interest would be
      paid for most adequately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these services are what?&rdquo; asked Roderick, with a
      delighted gleam in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to that presently. Where is Grant Jones?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was to follow me here in half an hour. Time&rsquo;s almost up,
      unless he&rsquo;s on the trail of a newspaper scoop.&rdquo; Roderick was
      smiling happily now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall await his coming. What do you say to a little music
      to beguile the time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major glanced at his violin resting on a side table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing would give me greater pleasure,&rdquo; responded Roderick,
      jumping up with alacrity and handing to the master his old Cremona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you like music,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton, as he began to
      tighten his bow. &ldquo;Its rhythmic cadences of tone are a language
      universal. Its power is unseen but felt, captivating and enthralling alike
      the cultured and the untutored. The harmony of tone enwraps the soul like
      a mantle. It influences heart and intellect It may depress in saddest
      tears or elevate to highest ecstasy. Music is the melody of the Gods. It
      is like an ethereal mist&mdash;a soft and dainty distillation of a
      thousand aromatic perfumes, inspiring and wholesome to the soul as the
      morning dew is to buds and blossoms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he had been gently thrumming the strings, and now he placed
      the violin to his chin. Soft and plaintive melodies alternating with wild
      and warring airs followed one after the other until the entire room seemed
      to be quivering with melody. For fully an hour, unconscious of the passing
      time, the Major entertained his guest, and concluded with a rapid surging
      theme as if it were a call to battle and for greater achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones had not yet arrived. Roderick recovered from the trance into
      which the music had thrown him. He thanked the Major for the pleasure he
      had given, then threw a glance at the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the deuce can he be?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the very moment the door opened, and in walked the belated editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been all this time?&rdquo; asked Roderick, half
      petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the porch of course,&rdquo; replied Grant. &ldquo;Do you think I
      was going to interrupt such divine melody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton smiled pleasedly while he laid down the violin on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be seated, Grant, my boy. I am going
      to lose no further time. I have some figures to work on tonight. This is
      my first night at home, Roderick, for many weeks. Grant already knows the
      story. Now I shall tell it to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And straightway the Major related how Jim Rankin, Tom Sun, and Boney
      Earnest had garnered the midnight harvests of gold. Then he drew aside the
      curtain hanging on the wall, unlocked the stout door which it concealed,
      and, to Roderick&rsquo;s amazement, displayed the piled up sacks of golden
      ore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All quite equal to the rich samples you handled here several months
      ago,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton, as he waved his hand toward the
      accumulated treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Cæsar!&rdquo; gasped Roderick. &ldquo;There must be hundreds
      of thousands of dollars there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The total will run into millions, young man,&rdquo; smiled the
      Major. Then he closed the door, relocked it, and dropped the curtain. But
      he did not resume his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this is where your services, and those of Grant Jones will come
      in. This great wealth must be safely transported to Denver. And as I have
      already explained to you tonight, I still want to guard jealously my
      secret of the Hidden Valley on whose resources I may or may not draw again&mdash;this
      the future must decide. All of us who are interested have abundance for
      the present; we are equipped for many good works. The removal of this
      large quantity of ore, without attracting public attention here, requires
      good judgment on the part of men who can be absolutely trusted. You are
      the men selected for the responsible duty. And remember it will be
      dangerous duty should our secret leak out. The days of hold-ups are
      passing in the West, but have not yet passed; for as you both know there
      are still a good few desperadoes among the wilds of our Wyoming mountains.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God&mdash;what loot!&rdquo; murmured Roderick, glancing toward
      the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a rich loot,&rdquo; acquiesced the Major. &ldquo;Now you
      young men will understand that your interests are my own&mdash;that while
      I am delighted to share this treasure with my chosen friends, these
      friends have been and continue to be quite indispensable to me. Roderick,
      your question earlier in the evening is answered&mdash;you will have a
      rightful share in this gold. Get ready in about a week&rsquo;s time to
      earn it Now go tonight. I will see you later on to unfold my plans for the
      journey in closer detail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great guns,&rdquo; groaned Grant Jones, as the two young men gained
      the roadway. &ldquo;What a newspaper story&mdash;what a scoop! And not one
      damned word can be put in type.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;A WARNING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>Y SUBTLE alchemy
      of thought Roderick&rsquo;s feelings toward Scotty Meisch had become
      entirely changed. On the ranch he had treated the rough, uncultivated and
      at times insolent youth with contempt that was scarcely concealed. He was
      not of his class; and Roderick by his manner had shown that he counted
      Scotty as outside the pale of good breeding&mdash;a fellow not to be
      associated with except in the necessary work of roping a steer or handling
      a mob of cattle. It had been almost an act of condescension on his part to
      accept Scotty&rsquo;s challenge to try out their respective riding
      abilities at the frontier fair. Any hurt the lad might have received in
      the contest was part of the day&rsquo;s game, and at the moment Roderick
      had treated the incident with indifference. But now he found himself
      feeling quite solicitous as to the poor fellow&rsquo;s condition. Of
      course Gail Holden, who had interested herself in the injured cowboy, had
      nothing to do with this change of sentiment&mdash;at least Roderick&rsquo;s
      consciousness took no cognizance of her influence in the matter. All the
      same, as he walked over to the hospital on the following afternoon to
      inquire about the invalid, he was conning in his mind the chances of
      perhaps meeting Gail there.
    </p>
    <p>
      However Scotty Meisch was alone when Roderick was admitted to the ward.
      There was only another occupant of the long room, occupying a cot at the
      farther end. The nurse as she brought Roderick to Scotty&rsquo;s bedside
      declared that her patient was getting along fine, and that a visit from a
      friend would cheer him up and do him good. Roderick smiled as he sat down
      at the foot of the bed and the nurse moved away to attend to other duties.
      Except for a bandaged head the cowboy looked fairly fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, old man?&rdquo; Roderick asked in a kindly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotty seemed quite disconcerted by this friendly greeting. He looked
      sheepish and shame-faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be all right in no time,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Expect
      you think I&rsquo;m a mean cuss,&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause, glancing at Roderick then hastily looking away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said so,&rdquo; replied Roderick in a pleasant and
      assuring way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know you hain&rsquo;t said it. But I&rsquo;ve never, liked
      you from the first time we met over at the Shield&rsquo;s ranch. I don&rsquo;t
      know why&mdash;damned if I do. But I didn&rsquo;t like you and don&rsquo;t
      like you now, and I&rsquo;m gosh&rsquo;lmighty ashamed of myself fer bein&rsquo;
      so ornery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t speak of yourself so harshly,&rdquo; said
      Roderick, somewhat interested in the turn the conversation was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve any kindness at your hands,&rdquo; Meisch
      went on. &ldquo;I sure planned to kill you onct &lsquo;til I found out you
      weren&rsquo;t sweet on Barbara Shields. Oh, I&rsquo;m a low-down cuss, but
      I&rsquo;m ambitious. You hain&rsquo;t the feller I&rsquo;m after any more.
      It&rsquo;s that lawyer Carlisle and I&rsquo;ll git him, you jist see. He&rsquo;s
      got to keep out of my way,&rdquo; and as Scotty, with a black scowl on his
      face, said this he looked the part of an avenging demon right enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Barbara is older than I am, but
      I&rsquo;m dead gone on her, even if she don&rsquo;t know it, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
      do things yet to that feller Carlisle.&rdquo; Roderick was fairly
      perplexed by these references to Barbara Shields and the disclosure of the
      rough cowboy&rsquo;s feelings toward his employer&rsquo;s daughter. For a
      moment he could not find the proper word to say. He just ventured a
      platitude, kindly spoken as it was kindly intended: &ldquo;Oh, you must
      get over these broodings, Scotty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not broodings&mdash;it&rsquo;s business, and I mean it,&rdquo;
      he muttered. &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t look so darned solemn. I&rsquo;ve
      no more bad feelin&rsquo;s agin you. But when you first came to the ranch,
      you know you couldn&rsquo;t ride any better than a kid. But you began
      givin&rsquo; yourself airs, an&rsquo; then when I thought you were goin&rsquo;
      to cut me out with Barbara I jist got plum crazy. That&rsquo;s why I sent
      you fair warnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light broke in on Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was you who slipped that note under Grant Jones&rsquo; door,
      was it?&rdquo; he asked in great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas. You can know it now; who cares? But it was only later I saw I
      was on a blind trail&mdash;that it was the other one you&rsquo;re after&mdash;goin&rsquo;
      fishin&rsquo; an&rsquo; all that sort o&rsquo; thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all fudge too,&rdquo; he exclaimed uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure &lsquo;bout that,&rdquo; replied Scotty, with
      a cunning look in his eyes. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sides, she&rsquo;s dead gone on
      you, that&rsquo;s a cert. She was here all yesterday afternoon, and could
      speak about nothin&rsquo; else&mdash;praised yer ridin&rsquo; and allowed
      she was tarnation sorry to have missed seein&rsquo; you on Gin Fizz. Which
      reminds me that I&rsquo;ve got to comgratulate you on the championship.&rdquo;
      He slipped a hand timidly and tentatively from under the bed-spread.
      &ldquo;Oh, I can admit myself beat when I&rsquo;m beat. You&rsquo;ve grown
      to be a better&rsquo;n rider than me. I&rsquo;m only a little skinny chap
      at the best, but you showed yourself strong enough to kill that great big
      steer in the bull-doggin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ve got me skinned, and you hold
      the championship right enough. Shake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Scotty at last mustered up the moral courage to extend his hand.
      Roderick took it and shook it warmly. So Gail had been talking about him!&mdash;his
      heart had leaped with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you speak like that, Scotty,&rdquo; he said
      with great cordiality. &ldquo;You and I can come to be mighty good
      friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, but I wish I looked like you,&rdquo; remarked Scotty, lapsing
      into a half smile. &ldquo;Shake hands again with me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick reached over and once more bestowed a good honest squeeze; and he
      improved the occasion by begging Scotty not to indulge in evil thoughts
      about killing people or anything of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you kind t&rsquo; me?&rdquo; asked the lad as he looked
      inquiringly at Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I have been particularly kind to you,&rdquo;
      replied Roderick. &ldquo;I begin to realize that I should have been here
      before now to help cheer you up a bit while convalescing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotty turned from Roderick and looking at the ceiling was silent for a
      few moments. At last he said: &ldquo;Expect if I&rsquo;d stay here a long,
      long time you&rsquo;d keep on bein&rsquo; kind t&rsquo; me. Possibly you
      would bring Barbara with you on some of your visits. But I know I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; get well, that&rsquo;s the pity of it all. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      be in bed now if the doctor hadn&rsquo;t said I got ter stay here for a
      few days. When I&rsquo;m well, why, then it&rsquo;s all off with you an&rsquo;
      Scotty. You won&rsquo;t pay any more attention to me when I&rsquo;m once
      more sound as a nut an&rsquo; ridin&rsquo; range than you would a low down
      coyote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I become indifferent to you?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no reason why you should, only you will,&rdquo; replied Scotty.
      &ldquo;You are of the high-falutin&rsquo; an&rsquo; educated kind an&rsquo;&mdash;well,
      I never went to school more&rsquo;n two weeks in my life. I got tired of
      the educatin&rsquo; business&mdash;stole a horse and never did go back. An&rsquo;
      they never caught me, nuther.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He brightened up when he said this and laughed at his cleverness as if it
      were a most pleasant remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was your childhood home?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, right there,&rdquo; replied Scotty, &ldquo;is where yer
      presumin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re not talkin&rsquo; to me. D&rsquo;ye suppose
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter tell yer and have this whole business piped off
      and those fellers come out here an&rsquo; pinch me for hoss-stealin&rsquo;.
      Not on yer life, so long as Scotty Meisch knows himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick smiled as he said: &ldquo;Surely, Scotty, you are a very
      suspicious person. I had no thought of doing what you suggest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; drawled Scotty, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d have been as
      near goin&rsquo; to the penitentiary as often as I have, you&rsquo;d learn
      to keep yer mouth shut when people begin to inquire into your past hist&rsquo;ry
      an&rsquo; not unbosom yerself. Fact is, my hist&rsquo;ry won&rsquo;t stand
      investigatin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s fuller of thin places an&rsquo; holes than
      an old-fashioned tin corn grater. You know what a grater is, don&rsquo;t
      you? It&rsquo;s a tin bent over into a half moon an&rsquo; nailed to a
      board with holes punched from inside out to make it rough. Where I come
      from we used to husk new corn just as soon as it was out of the milk an&rsquo;
      grate it into meal. About the only thing we had to live on was cornmeal
      mush an&rsquo; milk. Wish I had some now. I&rsquo;m hungrier than hell for
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The primitiveness of it all rather appealed to Roderick, and he called the
      nurse and asked if she wouldn&rsquo;t serve the patient with some cornmeal
      mush with milk for dinner that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if Dr. Burke does not object,&rdquo;
      and went away to make inquiries. In a little while she returned and said:
      &ldquo;The doctor says a nice bowl of cornmeal mush and milk would be just
      the thing for Mr. Meisch.&rdquo; And it was so arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the nurse had gone Roderick noticed a tear trickling down the cheek
      of Scotty and in order not to embarrass the boy he turned away and stood
      looking out of the window. Presently Scotty said: &ldquo;I wish ter hell I
      was decent, that&rsquo;s what I wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without turning from the window Roderick inquired: &ldquo;How old are you,
      Scotty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m about nineteen. I don&rsquo;t know fer sure. They
      never did tell me when my birthday was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to go to school, Scotty? Brace up and be an
      educated chap like other fellows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me learn to read an&rsquo; write?&rdquo; exclaimed Scotty. &ldquo;Look
      here, Mr. Warfield, are you chaffin&rsquo; me? That&rsquo;s what some
      Englishmen called it when they meant teasin&rsquo; and so I say chaffin&rsquo;.
      Might as well use all the big words a feller picks up on the way.&rdquo;
      Roderick laughed aloud at Scotty&rsquo;s odd expressions and turned to him
      and said: &ldquo;Scotty, you aren&rsquo;t a bad fellow. You have a good
      heart in you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Scotty, shaking his
      head. &ldquo;One time there was a feller told me that tough cusses like me
      don&rsquo;t have hearts&mdash;just gizzards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Roderick, laughing, &ldquo;my time has come to go
      now but I want to tell you I like you, Scotty. You seem to me to be the
      making of a very decent sort of chap, and if you will be a real good
      fellow and are sincere about wanting to go to school and make something of
      yourself, I believe I can arrange for you to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, Mr. Warfield, honest? Are you tellin&rsquo; me the truth or
      is this a sick bed jolly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I am telling you the truth,&rdquo; replied Roderick.
      &ldquo;You think it all over until I come and see you again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&rsquo;ll you come? Tomorrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Roderick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Scotty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sure look for yer.&rdquo;
      The next day when Roderick called, Major Buell Hampton and Grant Jones
      accompanied him. They had a long talk with Scotty whose rapid recovery
      showed improvement even from the previous day. After the subject had been
      introduced by Roderick, who told Scotty that he had informed his friends
      of the lad&rsquo;s desire to go to school, Major Buell Hampton observed:
      &ldquo;A printing office, Mr. Meisch, is a liberal education within
      itself. I have been talking this matter over with Mr. Jones, the Editor of
      the <i>Dillon Doublejack,</i> and with Mr. Warfield, and we have mutually
      agreed that if you are in earnest about leaving the range for a while and
      will learn to read books and generally improve your mind, we shall give
      you the opportunity. As soon as you are able to leave the hospital, how
      would you like to go over to the little town of Dillon with Mr. Grant
      Jones, this gentleman at my right, and go into his printing office?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be my devil to start in with,&rdquo; said Grant,
      good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;d about fit me,&rdquo; responded Scotty with a
      grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sort of a devil anyway, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; and
      he looked toward Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones means a different kind of a devil, Scotty,&rdquo; laughed
      Roderick. &ldquo;What Major Buell Hampton suggests to you is most
      excellent advice, and I think you had better accept the offer. This job
      will give you a home, and you will work in the printing office. You will
      soon learn to read books, and also you will become a typesetter which, as
      Major Hampton told you, is a practical education within itself and will
      lead to better things and greater things along educational lines. Of
      course, it may be some time before that knock on your head gets all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about my old bean,&rdquo; said Scotty with a
      smile, as he touched the bandage that encircled his cranium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Scotty said he believed he would like to try the new job. &ldquo;You
      know, I&rsquo;ve been knocked &lsquo;round over the world an&rsquo; kicked
      an&rsquo; thumped an&rsquo; had my ears cuffed an&rsquo; my shins barked
      so much that I don&rsquo;t hardly know what to make uv you fellers. If I
      was sure you wasn&rsquo;t stringin&rsquo; me an&rsquo; really meant it all
      as a kindness, why, I&rsquo;ll be goshdamed if I wouldn&rsquo;t git up out
      o&rsquo; bed this minute an&rsquo; start for Dillon. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d
      do. I ain&rsquo;t no piker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was very amusing to Grant Jones; and he assured the injured
      boy that he himself was not going over to Dillon for perhaps a week, by
      which time if he were attentive to the instructions of the doctor he
      probably would be able to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you over,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll
      batch it together so far as a place to sleep is concerned in the printing
      office. There is a good boarding house just across the street where you
      can get your meals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter pay for them?&rdquo; asked Scotty.
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got any money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;is what Major Buell Hampton is
      going to do for you. Not only will he pay your board for one year until
      your work is worth wages in the printing office, but he will also get you
      some new clothes and a new pair of shoes and rig you out in good shape,
      old man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, but you&rsquo;re good to me, Major Hampton, and Warfield too.
      Yer ought ter cuff my ears instead uv bein&rsquo; so all-fired kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the loveless boy turned towards the wall and covered his face.
      Both Major Hampton and Grant, as well as Roderick, were noticeably
      affected, and the three walked over toward the window while Scotty was
      collecting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Grant, sotto voce, &ldquo;in the language of Jim
      Rankin, the worst that poor little devil will get&mdash;if he goes with me&mdash;will
      be the best of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the visitors turned round to say good-by. The invalid had had about
      enough excitement for one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they were departing, Scotty beckoned Roderick to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute or two with me&mdash;alone,&rdquo; he whispered.
      &ldquo;I wants ter tell you somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick excused himself to the others; he would join them on the porch
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotty&rsquo;s face wore a keen eager look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, if I helps you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be doin&rsquo;
      a good turn, won&rsquo;t I, to the girl that saved my life by hurryin&rsquo;
      me along to this &lsquo;orspital here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she will count it as a favor,&rdquo; replied Roderick.
      &ldquo;How can you help me, Scotty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be doin&rsquo; you a favor,&rdquo; continued
      the lad, without answering the direct question, &ldquo;if I do a good turn
      to your friend with the name that reminds me of Bull Durham terbaccer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buell Hampton,&rdquo; laughed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Major you also call him. Wal, I can drop him a word o&rsquo;
      warnin&rsquo; too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has never a thought about love affairs,&rdquo; replied
      Roderick, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is a warnin&rsquo; of another kind. Listen.&rdquo; And
      Scotty drew himself up to a sitting posture on the bed. &ldquo;Come
      nearer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick complied; his ear was close to Scotty&rsquo;s lips. The cowboy
      spoke in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Major&rsquo;s got a pile o&rsquo; rich ore stored in his house.
      There&rsquo;s a bunch o&rsquo; fellers agoin&rsquo; to get it, an&rsquo;
      they&rsquo;ll shoot to kill as sure as God made hell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick mastered his emotion of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is this to take place, Scotty?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any night after tonight. Tonight they&rsquo;ve fixed to square
      accounts with some sheep herders over Jack Creek way. Then they&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; for the Major.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick gripped the other&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scotty, you have done me the biggest service in the world,&rdquo;
      he said earnestly. &ldquo;But one thing more&mdash;who are these men?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dassn&rsquo;t tell. They&rsquo;d plug me full o&rsquo; holes the
      moment I got out o&rsquo; here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick felt perplexed. He did not like to press for information that
      might seem to threaten danger for Scotty himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was watching his face furtively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re straight&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never give a feller
      like me away if I tell you one name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. You may stake your life on that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t care what happens to him anyway. He&rsquo;s a
      bad egg&mdash;a rotten bad egg clean through. And I&rsquo;m done with him
      from now right on. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to take that printin&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s
      job and act on the square.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Scotty. And we&rsquo;ll all help you to get
      clear of bad companions and bad influences. So it&rsquo;s all right for
      you to give me that name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll be pleased too, won&rsquo;t she, that Holden
      young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be always grateful to you for saving Buell Hampton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;nuff for me. The leader o&rsquo; that gang is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotty paused a moment; Roderick waited, silent and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bud Bledsoe,&rdquo; whispered the lad. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve
      stopped hatin&rsquo; you, I&rsquo;ve sort o&rsquo; turned to hatin&rsquo;
      him and all his kind. But you&rsquo;ll not give me away, Warfield? I wants
      ter hold down that printin&rsquo; job&mdash;that editor feller will make a
      man of me, that&rsquo;s just how I feel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just as we all feel,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;Now, Scotty,
      you must lie down. Let me fix your pillow for you. You&rsquo;ve got some
      fever yet, I can see. You must rest, old fellow. You look tired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m doggoned tired,&rdquo; murmured the lad wearily, as
      he sank back on the pillow and closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sleeping now, I think,&rdquo; said Roderick to the nurse as
      he passed quietly out of the ward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;THE TRAGEDY AT JACK CREEK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER a brief
      consultation on the hospital veranda, Buell Hampton, Roderick and Grant
      decided on an immediate consultation with Jim Rankin. They found the
      ex-sheriff busy among the horses down at the brush stable over the hill
      from the Major&rsquo;s home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim received the startling news with great complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expectin&rsquo; tumultuous news o&rsquo; this kind
      for quite a while,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m up to all the
      didoes o&rsquo; both the cowpunchers and the sheep herders. Never mind how
      I got to know them things. I just know &lsquo;em, and that&rsquo;s &lsquo;nuff
      said, good and plenty, for all present. If the cowpunchers are going to
      Jack Creek tonight, there will be hell a-poppin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not murder, surely?&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there&rsquo;s no sayin&rsquo; how them things end,&rdquo;
      replied Jim. &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s this way. The cowpunchers claim
      they&rsquo;re afeard the sheep&rsquo;ll cross over Jack Creek, an&rsquo;
      they&rsquo;ll go armed with great big clubs as well as shootin&rsquo;
      irons. They&rsquo;ll undertake, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;lowin&rsquo;, ter kill
      with their dubs a whole lot o&rsquo; sheep, maybe the hull kit an&rsquo;
      bilin&rsquo; uv &lsquo;em, shoot up the mess wagons where the sheep
      herders are sleepin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the chances are nine outer ten that
      they&rsquo;ll kill the herders an&rsquo; then jist nachur&rsquo;ly burn
      the wagons an&rsquo; the corpses, kill the shepherd dogs too an&rsquo;
      throw them on ter the fire and generally do a hellish piece uv intimidatin&rsquo;
      work. They&rsquo;ll burn the wagons ter hide evidence uv their guilt. You
      bet they&rsquo;ll git keerless with their artillery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; murmured Roderick in horror and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must stop this murderous business,&rdquo; remarked Buell
      Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And get hold of Bud Bledsoe before he can do further harm,&rdquo;
      suggested Grant Jones. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hunt up the sheriff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, just go slow, g&rsquo;nlemen, please,&rdquo; replied Jim,
      expectorating an inconvenient mouthful of tobacco juice and wiping his
      lips with the back of his hand. &ldquo;Jist you leave this business to me.
      I&rsquo;ve been prognosticatin&rsquo; trouble for months back, an&rsquo;
      know jist how to act. No sheriff is wanted&mdash;at least not the bum
      sheriff we&rsquo;ve got at the present time. He needs no warnin&rsquo;
      from us&mdash;mark my words. And even if he didn&rsquo;t chance to know
      what we might be tellin&rsquo; him, when he did know, it would be his
      pertic&rsquo;lar business to arrive after the killin&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      politics. Do you git me, Major?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I get you all right, Jim,&rdquo; replied Buell
      Hampton gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us go and see Ben Bragdon,&rdquo; proposed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; replied Jim excitedly. &ldquo;Hell, man,
      he&rsquo;s the attorney fur the cattle fellers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a gentleman,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, &ldquo;and if he is
      the attorney for the cow men, so much the better. He would advise the
      bosses of this contemplated lawbreaking raid and murder, and of course
      they would immediately take steps to keep the cowboys from committing such
      wickedness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Rankin&rsquo;s black eyes fairly snapped as he looked Roderick
      straight in the face and exclaimed: &ldquo;Roderick, are yer as big a
      tenderfoot as that? Don&rsquo;t yer know the cowboys don&rsquo;t go out
      murderin&rsquo; uv their own accord on these here cut-throat raids? They
      go, by gunnies, &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re paid by the higher ups ter do
      these dastardly killin&rsquo; acts. Why, gosh &lsquo;lmighty, Ben Bragdon
      draws a monthly retainer fee uv several figures ter protect the higher ups
      an&rsquo; there yer are, plain as a handle on a gourd. No, by gunnies,
      while the Major and Mr. Jones keep guard here, you an&rsquo; me, Roderick,
      will have ter go alone an&rsquo; jist nachurally take the law into our own
      hands. We&rsquo;ll have plenty uv shootin&rsquo; irons an&rsquo; loco the
      cowboys by shootin&rsquo; an&rsquo; wingin&rsquo; two or three uv &lsquo;em,
      Bud Bledsoe in pertic&rsquo;lar. Oh, you bet I know how to do this job,&rdquo;
      and he chuckled reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      pretend to know these cold-blooded murdering ways of the West or anything
      of this lawless feud that is going on between the cattlemen and the sheep
      men. However, I will go with you, Jim. When shall we start?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately after supper. There&rsquo;s no moon and it looks a
      little squally. It will be darker than a stack of black cats, but by
      gunnies, I know the way. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to have yer shootin&rsquo;
      irons ready, follow me and shoot when I shoot Now I guess there&rsquo;s no
      need my onbosomin&rsquo; myself any more,&rdquo; he added with a
      comprehensive glance around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was unable to repress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Jim, I&rsquo;m game, and ready for the lark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gunnies, it ain&rsquo;t no lark howsumever; I know yer game,&rdquo;
      replied Rankin. &ldquo;You bet I kin tell a scrapper when I see him. Now
      not a word to anyone else besides us four&mdash;exceptin&rsquo; of course,
      Boney Earnest I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; over to the smelter right now, and
      will arrange for him to be here tonight to help the Major.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Tom Sun?&rdquo; asked Roderick, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s in no danger. Them fellers are after his herders but
      not after the big man. They know better&mdash;the law would be poppin&rsquo;
      like hell if they ever made the mistake o&rsquo; hurtin&rsquo; one o&rsquo;
      the higher-ups.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, Mr. Sun is at Rawlins today on business,&rdquo; observed
      Buell Hampton. &ldquo;He is riding, and is to come straight here. But he
      told me not to expect him until midnight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which the cowpunching gang know quite well,&rdquo; said Jim
      emphatically. &ldquo;You bet they are playin&rsquo; up tonight jist
      because they cal&rsquo;clate on his absence. Now we&rsquo;ll be a-movin&rsquo;.
      Major, get your rifles well oiled&mdash;you may need &lsquo;em. My ridin&rsquo;
      hoss is over at the livery barn, and you an&rsquo; me, Roderick, will
      start from there at eight o&rsquo;clock sharp. Oh, you bet we&rsquo;ll
      have tumultuous doin&rsquo;s. Jist you an&rsquo; me &lsquo;ll show these
      killin&rsquo; cusses they&rsquo;re holdin&rsquo; bob-tailed flushes fur
      oncet. They won&rsquo;t show up here for the gold ore after we&rsquo;re
      through with &lsquo;em. Reminds me uv the old sheriff days, boys. An&rsquo;
      its &lsquo;lmighty good to be back to them,&rdquo; he added, pushing his
      hat back on his head determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we must put you up for sheriff again next election,&rdquo;
      laughed Grant Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m prognosticatin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
      replied the rugged old frontiersman, with a grim smile. &ldquo;Folks will
      see who&rsquo;s the real sheriff tonight&mdash;me or that white-livered
      double-dealin&rsquo; cur. Mills.&rdquo; And he strode away in the
      direction of the smelting plant, chewing his tobacco cud vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour that night Roderick was at the livery barn, and got
      ready his faithful horse, Badger. He had only waited a few minutes when
      Jim Rankin made his appearance. They were soon in their saddles and headed
      for Jack Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was very dark, and despite the would-be sheriff&rsquo;s vaunted
      knowledge of the country they lost themselves several times, and on one
      occasion had to retrace their steps four or five miles. Wherever it was
      possible they urged their horses on as rapidly as was prudent, but often
      for long distances it was a case of picking their way at a walking pace
      through the inky blackness. It was within an hour of midnight when at last
      they turned from the main road to the westward along the north bank of
      Jack Creek, which was the dividing line between the flockmasters&rsquo;
      and the cattle men&rsquo;s range. Rankin explained that the bands of sheep
      were being held about two miles on to the westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone very far up the creek when they were startled by the
      sight of two great fires burning like haystacks. They spurred their horses
      and hurried as fast as possible over the uncertain and little used road,
      and soon came upon a weird and terrible scene. Some three or four hundred
      sheep had been clubbed to death and lay like scattered boulders over the
      ground, while the two covered wagons where the herders cooked their meals
      and likewise slept were fast burning to ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gunnies,&rdquo; said Jim Rankin, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t get here
      quick enough. They&rsquo;ve sure done their hellish work. I&rsquo;ll bet
      there&rsquo;s two sheep herders an&rsquo; two shepherd dogs bumin&rsquo;
      to cinders in them there fires. It&rsquo;s hell, ain&rsquo;t it? They beat
      us to it for sure. But usually them doin&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t come off
      &lsquo;til one or two o&rsquo;clock in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the balance of the sheep?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
      &ldquo;I thought you said there were several thousand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, boy,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re chasin&rsquo; down
      toward Saratoga as if the wolves were after them. There&rsquo;s &lsquo;bout
      three thousand sheep in each band an&rsquo; there were two bands uv
      &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then four masked men rode up out of the darkness toward the burning
      outfits, but quickly checked their horses when they saw the two mounted
      strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, Roderick, don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; whispered
      Jim. &ldquo;By gunnies, they&rsquo;ve got us covered. Don&rsquo;t lift
      your artillery. They&rsquo;ll kill us sure if yer do.&rdquo; Then he
      raised his trembling voice in a shout: &ldquo;Hey, you fellers, we seed
      somethin&rsquo; burnin&rsquo; here. Wonder what &lsquo;tis?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep guttural voice came back: &ldquo;You two &lsquo;ll find it a dam
      sight more healthy to git back on the main road an&rsquo; tend to your own
      business. You have got jist one minute to start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Jim, agitatedly, whirling his horse, putting
      spurs to him and leaving Roderick trailing far behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick rode along toward the main road which they had just left after
      crossing over Jack Creek. He was disgusted with it all and with Jim Rankin&rsquo;s
      poltroonery in particular. The sight he had seen by the gleaming light of
      the burning wagons was ghastly. The innocent, helpless sheep that had been
      clubbed to death through the selfishness of men. He was in no mood for
      hilarity. It was a sight that would remain with him and haunt him. Then
      too, he had received a new measure of Jim Rankin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roderick Warfield had all the blind audacity of youth and did not give
      the old westerner Jim Rankin the credit he deserved. Jim Rankin was versed
      in the ways of these western transgressors, and knew the price he and
      Roderick would have to pay for &ldquo;butting in&rdquo; on a quarrel
      between the cattle and the sheep men that was no direct concern of
      outsiders. This price was death, swift and merciless.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Roderick reached the highway he pulled his horse to the right toward
      the bridge that spanned Jack Creek. As he approached the bridge he heard
      someone say: &ldquo;Here he comes now.&rdquo; The voice was not Jim Rankin&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; came a call in yet another voice, just as his horse
      reached the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Roderick,&rdquo; cried Jim Rankin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s with you?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick rode up and found three men with drawn revolvers, and one of them
      proved to be the sheriff of the county and the others his deputies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the sheriff, &ldquo;you are accused of
      killing a lot of sheep up here on Jack Creek and burning a couple of
      wagons, and I arrest you in the name of the law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; inquired Roderick, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said the sheriff, &ldquo;you fellers will fork
      over your shootin&rsquo; irons quietly and submit to being handcuffed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mills,&rdquo; said Rankin, resentfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; too dangnation far, by gunnies. I&rsquo;ll be responsible for
      young Warfield, here. I&rsquo;ll go his bail. Dangnation, don&rsquo;t
      press me any furder or I&rsquo;ll git peevish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Sheriff Mills, hesitatingly, &ldquo;who will
      be responsible for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Gosh&rsquo;lmighty, Mills, we&rsquo;ve know&rsquo;d each other
      fur twenty-five years. You go my security yourself or by the great horn
      spoon you&rsquo;ll not kerry Rawlins precinct next election.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch that young feller,&rdquo; instructed the sheriff to his
      deputies. &ldquo;Ride over this way, Jim, where we can speak privately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Rankin called out: &ldquo;Come on, Roderick, let&rsquo;s
      be goin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; late. Everything&rsquo;s all
      right.&rdquo; And together they headed their horses for Encampment and
      rode on in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Rankin presently said: &ldquo;Well, by gunnies, Tom Sun has leastways
      got to hand it to us fur tryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick made no immediate reply and they continued their way in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Roderick spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were mighty friendly with that white-livered, double-dealing
      cur, the sheriff&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you called him a few hours ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he wasn&rsquo;t present with a gun in his hand,&rdquo;
      replied Jim. &ldquo;He sure &lsquo;nuff had the drop on us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you square him then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politics,&rdquo; came the sententious answer. &ldquo;And I guess I
      put one over him at that. Somebody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to git a dangnation
      throw-down, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you forgit it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later they descended at the livery barn. The sky had cleared, and
      they had ridden fast under the starlight. Roderick looked the ex-sheriff
      squarely in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jim Rankin, the next move in the game is going to be mine. Get
      your three fours hitched up at once, and bring them down one by one as
      fast as they are ready, to the Major&rsquo;s. We load that ore tonight,
      and start for the railroad before daylight. Do you get me, my friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Rankin for a moment looked into Roderick&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I git you, Mr. Warfield,&rdquo; he replied, as he meekly
      turned away toward the stables where the twelve powerful draught horses
      had been held in preparedness for a week past.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;THE FIGHT ON THE ROAD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>AYLIGHT had not
      yet broken when the three four-horse wagons were loaded and ready for the
      road. Not a moment had been lost after Roderick&rsquo;s arrival at the
      Major&rsquo;s. That night he had had a grim glimpse of what western
      lawlessness among the mountains might mean, and had speedily convinced the
      Major that his policy of instant departure was the wise one. Bud Bledsoe
      and his gang would rest at least one day, perhaps two or three days, after
      their devilish exploit with the sheep-herders, and when they came
      reconnoitering around the blockhouse in which the ore was stored it would
      be to find the rich treasure gone. The teams by that time would be at
      Walcott, or at least well on the way to their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little bunch of friends had set to work with a will. Jim Rankin got
      the first team down within half an hour, and by that time the Major, Tom
      Sun, who had duly turned up from Rawlins, Boney Earnest, Grant Jones and
      Roderick had a goodly pile of the one-hundred-pound ore sacks stacked in
      front of the house, ready to be lifted into the wagon. Without a hitch or
      delay the work proceeded, and now that the loading was completed, and the
      rifles and ammunition had been stowed under the drivers&rsquo; seats, the
      tension of suppressed excitement was relaxed. Pipes were alight during a
      final consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three tough old westerners, it was settled, were to drive. Boney had
      announced his absolute determination to come along&mdash;the smelter could
      go to blazes, he had applied some days before for a week&rsquo;s leave
      anyways and if W. B. Grady chose to buck because he took it now, well he
      could &ldquo;buck good and plenty, and be damned to him.&rdquo; Tom Sun
      was keeping in stern repression his wrath against the miscreants who had
      massacred his sheep and probably killed his herders as well; it would be
      stern satisfaction for him to have a fight on the road, to settle accounts
      with Bud Bledsoe by the agency of a rifle bullet. Jim Rankin, after his
      quiet taking-down by Roderick at the livery stable, had recovered his
      accustomed self-assurance and bellicosity, and was &ldquo;prognosticating&rdquo;
      all manner of valorous deeds once it came to guns out on both sides and
      fair shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these three would manage the teams, Buell Hampton, Grant and
      Roderick would scout ahead on their riding horses, and provide a rear
      guard as well so that the alarm of any attempted pursuit could be given.
      Badger had been fed and rested, and looked fit for anything despite the
      night&rsquo;s ride to Jack Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumping into the saddle Roderick, accompanied by Grant Jones, who knew the
      road well, led the way. The wagons followed, while the Major delayed just
      long enough to lock up the house, including the now empty inner chamber,
      and clear away the traces of the night&rsquo;s work. The whole cavalcade
      was three or four miles out of Encampment before the sun had risen and the
      townsfolk were astir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance to be traversed was just fifty miles, and that night the
      first camp was made beyond Saratoga. No public attention had been drawn to
      the wagons; none of the people encountered on the road or at stopping
      places had any reason to think that these ordinary looking ore-sacks held
      gold that was worth a king&rsquo;s ransom. There had been no signs of
      ambushed robbers ahead nor of pursuit in the rear. But that night, while a
      few hours of sleep were snatched, watch was kept in turn, while each
      sleeper had his rifle close at hand. With the first glimmer of dawn the
      journey was resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well on in the afternoon when the Major spied, some distance out on
      the open country to the left, the dust raised by a small party of
      horsemen. He rode up to the wagons to consult his friends. He had just
      pointed out the sign to Jim Rankin, when the riders disappeared behind a
      rocky ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim had been shading his eyes while gazing fixedly. He now dropped his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gunnies, they are after us right enough,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;That was Bud Bledsoe in the lead&mdash;I know his ginger-colored
      pony. They&rsquo;re going to cross Pass Creek lower down, then they will
      swing around into White Horse Canyon, coming back to meet us after we&rsquo;ve
      crossed the bridge and are on the long steep hill just beyond. Dang me if
      that ain&rsquo;t their game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major rode ahead to warn Grant and Roderick. The bridge over Pass
      Creek was only three miles from Walcott. If the three scouts could gain
      the crest of the steep slope, before the robbers, the advantage of
      position would be theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick grasped the plan of campaign in an instant, and, digging his
      spurs into Badger&rsquo;s flank, galloped off full pelt. Grant and the
      Major followed at the best pace of their less mettled ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was less than a mile to the bridge, and Badger was soon breasting the
      hill at a swinging canter. Just before reaching the summit Roderick
      descended, and throwing the bridle over the pony&rsquo;s head tethered it
      in cowboy fashion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute, old fellow,&rdquo;
      he said, as he gave Badger an affectionate pat on the neck. Then, rifle in
      hand, he walked up the remaining few yards of the slope, and cautiously
      peered over the crest into White Horse Canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great Scott! seven or eight horsemen away down at the foot of the
      descending incline were just scrambling out of the waste of cacti and
      joshuas on to the roadway! The first comers were waiting for the
      stragglers, and a pow-wow was evidently being held. Roderick gripped the
      butt of his rifle. But he heard the clatter of hoofs behind him, and drew
      back for the time being. Waving a cautioning hand to Buell Hampton and
      Grant as they approached, he gave the news in a few words. It took only a
      minute to tie all three horses securely to the low-growing grease-wood
      that here skirted the road&mdash;the animals, although well-trained, might
      be stampeded by the shooting. Then, rifles in hand, Roderick, Grant and
      the Major crept up to the crest of the ridge. Before reaching it the sharp
      tattoo of horse hoofs smote their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Bud Bledsoe in the lead on the ginger pony,&rdquo;
      exclaimed Buell Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was needed by Roderick; if Bud Bledsoe was there, the gang
      were lawbreakers and bent on further villainy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went Roderick&rsquo;s rifle; and the ginger-colored
      horse plunged forward on his knees, and then rolled over, kicking wildly
      in the air. Two horses behind stumbled over the obstruction, and instantly
      there was a confused heap of struggling beasts and men. Four other riders
      had reined in their steeds just in time, and were standing stock-still on
      the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it up, but don&rsquo;t kill,&rdquo; muttered the Major, just
      before he fired his own rifle. Almost at the same instant came &ldquo;bang&rdquo;
      from Grant&rsquo;s shoulder, and a second shot by Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this fusillade the four cowboys still mounted jumped their horses into
      the sage brush and cacti and were gone like a streak across country. One
      of the fallen horses had struggled to its feet, and a figure leaped into
      the saddle. It was Bud Bledsoe&mdash;Roderick knew him by his gorilla-like
      figure. Leaving his two fallen comrades to their fate, the leader raced
      after the fleeing quartette. Three rifle bullets whizzed past him to
      quicken his pace. Then the marksmen on the ridge stood erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two motionless human figures lay on the road at the bottom of the hill;
      the ginger horse had rolled in among the bushes in his death throes, the
      other was limping along with a broken leg. Roderick ran down the slope on
      foot, leaving the others to follow with the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man he reached was dead, his neck broken by the fall. Roderick
      recognized him at a glance&mdash;for when once riding the range with a
      bunch of cowboys they had passed a lone rider on a mountain trail and the
      name had been passed around&mdash;Butch Cassidy, a horse rustler, and an
      outlaw of the hills. The other fellow was bleeding from a wound in his
      breast; there was a gulping gurgle in his throat. He had evidently been
      hit by Grant&rsquo;s first bullet, which had been fired too quick for any
      heed to be paid to Buell Hampton&rsquo;s merciful injunction. Just as
      Roderick raised the limp hand the wounded man opened his eyes; then he
      uttered one great sob and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later bullets from Grant&rsquo;s revolver put the injured
      horses out of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk of the falling night the dead men were borne on the ore wagons
      into Walcott. The station agent recognized the second corpse as that of a
      notorious gambler and hold-up artist, an old associate of Big-Nosed George
      in early days. The railroad man treated the bodies as trash, but
      condescended to wire down the line for the coroner and the sheriff. The
      car, which had been ordered several days before, was on the side track
      awaiting the ore shippers, and he counselled that there should be no delay
      in loading, as a through freight for Denver was due shortly after
      midnight. So the fight was forgotten, and the work of transferring the ore
      sacks from the wagons was soon in progress, all present, even the Major,
      lending a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the task had been completed, the bill of lading prepared and all
      charges prepaid, Jim Rankin, Boney Earnest, Tom Sun and Grant Jones
      boarded the car. They were well provided with blankets for bedding and
      still carried their rifles. Buell Hampton and Roderick remained to arrange
      for the sending back of the teams and saddle horses; they would follow on
      the morning passenger train, and the whole party would reach Denver
      practically at the same hour next night.
    </p>
    <p>
      No further incident occurred. But not until the carload of ore had been
      duly delivered, sampled, and weighed did the four faithful and well-armed
      guards relax their vigilance. The purchasers were the Globe Smelter
      Company, with whose manager Boney Earnest had personal acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      While secrecy was exercised concerning this remarkable ore shipment, yet
      the news gradually crept out and it became known that something phenomenal
      had occurred. The newspaper reporters hovered around the Globe Smelter
      endeavoring to pick up a few crumbs of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton and his friends were registered at the Brown Palace Hotel
      where they had arranged for connecting rooms. Two days afterwards Buell
      Hampton announced to his friends, in the privacy of his room, that the
      returns were all he had anticipated. The money had been duly deposited to
      his credit, and now he wrote checks running into five figures for each of
      his friends, and admonished them separately and collectively to deposit
      the money in some Denver bank to their individual credit, then return to
      their Encampment homes and each continue his avocation as if nothing had
      happened to improve their financial affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for myself,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;I have a mission to
      perform, and I probably will not return to Encampment for a matter of
      fifteen or twenty days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Major Hampton left for New York carrying with him certified
      checks for a large sum of money, and on the following morning the others
      took train for Wyoming. Within a few days all had resumed their accustomed
      routine. Jim Rankin was back on his stage coach making his usual trips;
      Boney Earnest, after an acrimonious scrap with Grady over the question of
      absence without leave, was in his old place before the blast furnace; Tom
      Sun regained his home at Split Rock, north of Rawlins, Grant Jones
      returned to his editorial duties, Roderick to his preparations for a
      prospecting expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Grant and Roderick had brought with them checks for a few thousand
      dollars, which they deposited in the local bank to the great surprise of
      the cashier. And even before leaving the bank they began to realize that
      their importance in the community had already gone up a hundred per cent.
      Such is the prompt efficacy of a substantial bank balance!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;SUMMER DAYS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ITHIN less than a
      year of his leaving Keokuk to play football with the world, as Uncle Allen
      Miller had phrased it, Roderick Warfield had established himself in a
      sound financial position. So far he had not been made the &ldquo;pig-skin&rdquo;
      in life&rsquo;s game. While he was filled with grateful feeling toward
      Buell Hampton, and recognized the noble generosity of his friend, he had
      at the same time the satisfaction of feeling that he had done at least a
      little toward earning a share in the proceeds derived from the carload of
      rich ore. And once he found his own mine, his father&rsquo;s mine, it
      would be his turn to follow the golden rule and share liberally with those
      around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had handed in the Denver check at the local bank, he had already
      found a new deposit to his credit there&mdash;a sum of money to which he
      had never given a thought from the moment it was won. This was the $450
      coming to him as the World&rsquo;s Championship prize in the rough-riding
      and outlaw-busting competition at the frontier celebration. It was with
      intense delight that Roderick decided to apply this windfall to finally
      clearing off his New York liabilities. He felt like walking even a bit
      more erect than ever now that he would owe not a dollar in the world.
      After luncheon he returned to the bank and secured eastern drafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a balance remaining, and Roderick at once thought of the lad
      who had not only suffered defeat in the contest but injury as well. Major
      Hampton had already undertaken the provision of clothes and other outfit
      for Scotty Meisch. Roderick thought for a moment; then he walked across to
      the Savings Bank and started an account in the cowboy&rsquo;s name with a
      credit of $100. He carried the little pass-book with him to the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Scotty reclining in a long chair on the veranda. The invalid was
      convalescent, although looking pale from the unwonted confinement. His
      face brightened with joy when Roderick, looking down with a pleasant
      smile, patted him on the shoulder and gripped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, but it&rsquo;s good to see you again,&rdquo; murmured the boy.
      &ldquo;It seems like a hell of a time since you were here. But I got the
      postcard you sent me from Denver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Scotty, as I wrote you, Grant Jones and I, also the Major,
      have all been to Denver. We were called away unexpectedly or would have
      paid you a parting visit. But I&rsquo;ve come around at once, you see.
      Grant Jones and I got back only this afternoon. Mr. Jones is going to take
      you over to Dillon next week. Meanwhile I have brought you this little
      book, old fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotty glanced at the pass-book, wonderingly and uncomprehendingly. He
      turned it over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s this piece o&rsquo; leather goods for?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you&rsquo;ve got $100 to your credit in the Savings
      Bank, Scotty&mdash;the consolation prize, you remember, in the
      broncho-busting contest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consolation prize be damned. There was no consolation prize.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a danged sight You&rsquo;ve gone an&rsquo; done this,
      Warfield.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I got the big money, and hasn&rsquo;t the winner the right to
      give off a bit of it as a consolation prize? Just stuff that book in your
      pocket, Scotty, and may the hundred dollars soon roll up to a thousand,
      old fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great guns, but you&rsquo;re powerful kind to me&mdash;all of you,&rdquo;
      murmured the cowboy. There were tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by the way, Scotty,&rdquo; continued Roderick, talking gaily,
      &ldquo;that reminds me, I&rsquo;ve got to go across to Englehart&rsquo;s
      store and take over that grand championship saddle he was showing in his
      window&mdash;Banker Buck Henry&rsquo;s special prize, you remember. I had
      almost forgotten about it. Why, it&rsquo;s mine&mdash;stamped leather,
      solid silver mounts, and all the gewgaw trimmings. How will I look riding
      the ranges with that sort of outfit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look just grand,&rdquo; exclaimed Scotty admiringly.
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t use that on the range. It will be your courtin&rsquo;
      outfit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotty smiled wanly, while Roderick laughed in spite of himself. The
      invalid felt emboldened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s been over here every day during your absence,&rdquo;
      he continued. &ldquo;Gee, but she&rsquo;s pretty, and she&rsquo;s kind!
      And let me tell you somethin&rsquo; else. Barbara&rsquo;s been a-visitin&rsquo;
      me too. Just think o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, all the girls are good, Scotty&mdash;and Wyoming girls the best
      of all,&rdquo; he added enthusiastically. There was safety in the general
      proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbara an&rsquo; I has made it all up,&rdquo; continued the lad,
      still smiling, wistfully yet happily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead stuck on
      that lawyer chap, Bragdon, and we shook hands over it. I wished her luck,
      and promised to vote for Bragdon at the election for state senator. An&rsquo;
      what do you think she did when I told her that?&rdquo; he asked, raising
      himself in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said &lsquo;Bully for you,&rsquo; I bet,&rdquo; replied
      Roderick. &ldquo;She did more. She kissed me&mdash;fair and square, she
      kissed me,&rdquo; Scotty put his finger-tips to his forehead. &ldquo;Oh,
      only there,&rdquo; he added, half regretfully. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll never
      forget the touch of her lips, her sweet breath in my face.&rdquo; And he
      patted the spot on his brow in appreciative reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s politics, as Jim Rankin would say,&rdquo; laughed
      Roderick, more to himself than to the cowboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s the sort o&rsquo; politics I like,&rdquo; replied
      Scotty. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;d even only cuff my ears every time I voted, I&rsquo;d
      be a repeater for Bragdon at the polls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll both vote the Bragdon ticket, Scotty. A girl like
      Barbara Shields is worth making happy, all the time. And later on, old
      fellow, the proper girl will be coming along for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if she was comin&rsquo; along for you right now,&rdquo;
      grinned Scotty, glancing toward the steps of the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a moment later Roderick was shaking hands with another hospital
      visitor, gazing into Gail Holden&rsquo;s blue eyes, and receiving her warm
      words of greeting over his safe return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard something about a fight near Walcott, you know, Mr.
      Warfield&mdash;about a mysterious carload of ore. Two hold-up men were
      killed, and your name was mentioned in connection with the affair. I felt
      quite anxious until Mr. Meisch received his postcard from Denver. But you
      never thought of writing to me,&rdquo; she added, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not dare,&rdquo; murmured Roderick in a low tone intended
      only for her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Scotty heard and Scotty saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the very hour the nurse says I&rsquo;ve got to sleep,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be clearin&rsquo; out, War-field.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me too?&rdquo; asked Gail, laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pair o&rsquo; you,&rdquo; replied the invalid, as he lay back
      languorously and closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better be going,&rdquo; laughed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Meisch is awake enough yet,&rdquo; said Gail, &ldquo;to
      hear that I brought over a chicken for his supper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the nurse I&rsquo;ll have it fried, please,&rdquo; yawned
      Scotty, as, without opening his eyes, he turned over his head in
      slumberous fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away then, Miss Holden,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;I suppose
      you rode over on Fleetfoot. I&rsquo;ll saddle Badger, and we&rsquo;ll have
      a gallop across country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doggoned politics there,&rdquo; exclaimed the cowboy, awaking
      suddenly, as he watched the handsome couple disappear. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      the real thing, sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer days glided past. The Major had returned from New York and had
      quietly resumed his old life of benevolence among the poor. But soon there
      seemed to be no more poverty in or around Encampment. Roderick, keeping
      the mining town as his headquarters, made a series of expeditions into the
      mountains, systematically searching every range and every known canyon. He
      would be absent for several days at a time, sometimes with Jim Rankin for
      a companion, Grant Jones once or twice accompanying him, but latterly with
      Boney Earnest as his <i>fidus Achates.</i> For Boney had severed his
      connection finally with the Smelter Company, after a quarrel with Grady
      that had ended in the blast furnace foreman knocking his employer down.
      Such is the wonderful independence that comes from a bank balance&mdash;even
      a secret bank balance that may not command the deference accorded to known
      financial prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between his prospecting expeditions Roderick spent an occasional evening
      either at the Conchshell Ranch or at the Major&rsquo;s, with a flying call
      now and then at the Shields home, especially when Grant was on one of his
      periodical visits to Encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month was now September. The rugged mountains still guarded their
      secret, and Roderick was beginning to fear that the quest for his father&rsquo;s
      mine was indeed going to be a vain one. But there came an interlude to his
      range-riding and gold-dreaming. The state conventions were approaching.
      Even love became a minor matter to politics. The air was surcharged with
      electricity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;RUNNING FOR STATE SENATOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T BREAKFAST table
      one morning Roderick noticed in the <i>Encampment Herald</i> a featured
      article about the forthcoming Republican convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Grant, when Roderick called his attention
      to it, &ldquo;this convention trouble has been brewing for some time.
      Personally, as you know, I am a Republican, even though my paper, the <i>Dillon
      Doublejack</i>, is a dyed-in-the-wool Democratic organ.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trouble,&rdquo; asked Roderick, &ldquo;can there possibly be
      about a county convention?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a senatorial convention,&rdquo; explained Grant. &ldquo;There
      is an old saying,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that every dog has his day.
      But unfortunately politically speaking there are more dogs than days, and
      when two or three contestants try to get in on the same day, why, somebody
      is going to get bitten. There is only one state senatorial job from this
      district but there may be half-a-dozen fellows who feel called upon to
      offer themselves upon the political altar of their country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have noticed a good many fellows down from the hills recently,&rdquo;
      replied Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s politics,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;They take a
      lay off from their work in the hills&mdash;come down here to fill up on
      free political whiskey furnished by the various candidates. Oh, take it
      from me,&rdquo; said Grant, looking wise and shaking his head, &ldquo;these
      delegates are a booze-fighting bunch for fair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two the journalistic oracle busied himself with his toast
      and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You watch the columns of my paper,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      going to show up these whiskey drinking, habits of the delegates good and
      plenty in this week&rsquo;s issue of the <i>Doublejack.</i> In the
      language of Jim Rankin I get a heap peevish with all this political
      foolishness. Still,&rdquo; Grant went on, &ldquo;I presume it is a part of
      the political machinery of the frontier. One thing,&rdquo; he concluded,
      &ldquo;we all become unduly excited in these ante-convention days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Political excitement had indeed waxed warm, and the little mining town had
      seemingly ceased to think about its mines, its great smelting plant, rich
      strikes in the hills and everything else&mdash;even the cattle men and the
      sheep men appeared to have forgotten their feuds together with their
      flocks and herds in the general excitement over the nomination for state
      senator from southern Carbon County.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones in his Doublejack editorials made emphatic and urgent appeal
      to the people to remember the doctrines of the old Simon-pure Jacksonian
      democracy and agree upon a good Democratic nominee. With a split in the
      Republican ranks the chances were never better for the election of a
      Democratic senator. He pointed out that if Bragdon won the nomination the
      Carlisle clique would secretly knife the Bragdon forces at the polls by
      voting the Democratic ticket, and on the other hand if Carlisle should
      best Bragdon in the nominating contest then the Bragdon following would
      retaliate by supporting the Democratic nominee so as to defeat Carlisle in
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Republican side W. Henry Carlisle, the astute lawyer, was backed by
      the smelter interests, while Ben Bragdon, the eloquent, was supported by
      the antismelter forces generally and also by Earle Clemens, editor of the
      <i>Encampment Herald,</i> one of the best known and most highly respected
      party leaders in the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The so-called smelter interests were certainly discredited because of the
      domineering insolence of W. B. Grady and his unfair treatment of the men.
      Not only did Grady practice every sort of injustice upon the employees of
      the great smelting plant in all its various departments, but he also
      quarreled with the ranchmen in the valley whenever he had dealings with
      them even to the extent of buying a load of hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As convention day approached there was a noticeable feeling of unrest and
      nervousness. Factional strife was running at high tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise men of the party said they could plainly see that unless harmony
      in the Republican ranks obtained at the convention the nominee would be
      defeated at the polls, and that if Ben Bragdon&rsquo;s nomination were
      insisted upon by his friends without in some way conciliating the Carlisle
      faction the Democrats would be almost certain to win at the following
      November&rsquo;s elections.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pretty generally conceded that Ben Bragdon, controlled the
      numerical strength of the delegates, but the wiseacres would ask in their
      solicitude: &ldquo;Is it wisdom to take such a chance? Does it not invite
      a split in the ranks of our party? In other words, does it not mean defeat
      for the Republican candidate on election day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlisle was a power to be reckoned with, and had a clannish, determined
      following in political affairs, and although he and his friends might be
      outnumbered and beaten in the nominating convention, yet what would follow
      if Bragdon&rsquo;s nomination were forced upon them? What would be the
      result? Would not Carlisle&rsquo;s following secretly slash the rival they
      had been unable to defeat at the nominating convention?
    </p>
    <p>
      A &ldquo;dark horse&rdquo; seemingly was the only way out of the dilemma,
      and the more conservative delegates insisted that Bragdon and his friends
      must be brought to understand and recognize the possibilities of almost
      certain defeat unless harmony could be insured; otherwise Bragdon must be
      compelled to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning before the day named for the senatorial convention to
      assemble at Rawlins the delegates at Encampment and several hundred
      friends of the respective candidates started overland for the convention
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two roads from Encampment to Rawlins&mdash;one that branched
      off from the so-called main road and went along the Platte River bottom.
      The distance by either route was about sixty miles. Carlisle and his
      following went one road, while Bragdon and his following traveled by the
      other road, both arriving at the hotel in Rawlins at the same time with
      panting horses. It was a mad race, each faction trying to show supremacy
      over the other even at the cost of horseflesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delegates gathered in knots of three and four in the lobby of the
      hotel, in the barroom and in the private rooms during the afternoon and
      evening before convention day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trains had arrived from the East and the West, and the delegates from
      all over the senatorial district were present and ready for the fray that
      was certain to come off the following day&mdash;indeed, Rawlins, the
      county seat, was alive with politicians and the Ferris House, the leading
      hotel of the place, was a beehive of activity. The Democratic spectators
      were jubilant and made their headquarters at Wren&rsquo;s saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the Ferris House that W. Henry Carlisle had opened his
      headquarters in opposition to Ben Bragdon. The Carlisle people said they
      had no alternative candidate. Any one of a score of men might be named in
      the district, each of whom would be satisfactory; in fact, anyone
      excepting Ben Bragdon, provided, of course, it was found that Carlisle
      could not be nominated, which they were far from conceding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bragdon and Carlisle had often before locked horns in hotly contested
      lawsuits up in the-hills, but in addition to their legal fights for
      supremacy there had been one special controversy that had resulted in a
      big financial loss for which each held the other responsible. It involved
      a bitter fight over a mining claim wherein both Bragdon and Carlisle had
      financial interests, and both had finally lost. It was a rich property and
      had by decree of the courts been awarded to a third party. But the
      decision did not lessen the feud. The impelling motive in their political
      contest was not half so much, perhaps, for the honor of being state
      senator as it was a consuming desire in the heart of each to best and lick
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the delegates, even those who were inclined to be friendly to
      Bragdon&rsquo;s candidacy, acknowledged that seemingly he had made no
      effort to pacify either Carlisle or his friends, and thus, in a way, had
      proven himself deficient as a political leader and standard-bearer for the
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others claimed that a reconciliation was impossible, that the breach was
      entirely too wide to be patched up at the eleventh hour. Still others were
      of the opinion that if the Bragdon forces would concede the chairmanship
      of the convention to Carlisle and his friends and thus give substantial
      evidence of a desire to harmonize and be friendly, past differences could
      be adjusted, with the result not only of Bragdon&rsquo;s nomination but
      his election as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those high in the leadership of the Bragdon forces laughed incredulously
      and scorned to consider such a compromising surrender, and further
      expressed their disbelief in the sincerity of Carlisle and his crowd even
      if the Bragdon following were willing to make such a concession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Big Phil Lee, Bragdon&rsquo;s chief lieutenant,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Kentucky Democrat, boys, as you all know, but in this
      fight I&rsquo;m for Bragdon&mdash;a Bragdon Republican&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve
      got the whip-hand and by the Eternal we will hold it. We Bragdon fellows
      have already agreed upon a chairman and a secretary for both the temporary
      and permanent organizations of tomorrow&rsquo;s convention, and we have
      selected Charlie Winter to name Bragdon in a nominating speech that will
      be so dangnation eloquent&mdash;well, it will simply carry everybody off
      their feet. He is the boy that can talk, you bet he is. Oh, you bet we&rsquo;ve
      got &lsquo;em licked, Carlisle and all his cohorts. And let me tell you
      something else,&rdquo; continued Big Phil Lee, gesticulating, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
      hold them responsible for the final result. If Bragdon&rsquo;s not
      elected, it will be because Carlisle and his gang knife him at the polls.
      Just let them do such a dirty contemptible piece of political chicanery
      and they&rsquo;ll be marked men ever afterwards in this senatorial
      district, and not one of them could be elected even to the office of dog
      pelter.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;UNEXPECTED POLITICAL HARMONY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS just such
      talk as Big Phil Lee&rsquo;s that kept the Bragdon forces lined up and
      defiant to the point of an open rupture and a total disregard for the
      minority, while the Democrats cheered Big Phil Lee&rsquo;s remarks with
      enthusiastic hoorays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual who really held the destiny of the party that year in the
      hollow of his hand and within the next few hours proved himself the Moses
      to lead all factions from the paths of bickering into the highway of
      absolute harmony, was the newspaper man, Earle Clemens. All through the
      evening hours the editor of the <i>Herald</i> had been a most eloquent
      listener. He was on good terms with everybody, jovial and mixed with all
      factions, and yet was scrupulously careful to avoid giving any expression
      of advice or stating an opinion. He had, however, been very outspoken in
      his editorial advocacy for harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earle Clemens was not only known and respected all over the state as an
      able newspaper man, but he was the possessor of a rich tenor voice that
      had delighted many an audience up in the hills, and then, too, he had
      composed the melody of the state song, entitled &ldquo;Wyoming&rdquo;&mdash;all
      of which tended to his great popularity and powerful influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it was quite generally known that Clemens was perhaps closer in his
      friendship for Bragdon than any other man in the district, dating from way
      back when the generous-hearted young lawyer had helped Clemens at a time
      and in a way that money could not buy or repay, yet the editor of the <i>Herald</i>
      had all along insisted that unless the Bragdon sympathizers effected a
      reconciliation with the Carlisle crowd, it virtually meant, if Bragdon&rsquo;s
      nomination were forced upon the convention, a Democratic victory at the
      coming November election.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his last editorial, before the convention was to assemble, he had, in
      reply to Democratic newspaper gibes about a high old row which was likely
      to obtain at the oncoming Republican convention, branded the writers one
      and all as political falsifiers. He boldly announced that not a single
      discordant note would be heard when the Republican host came to nominate
      its standard bearer, and furthermore that the choice would be emphasized
      by a unanimous vote of the delegates. And in the final event the
      Republican candidate, he declared, would be elected by such an
      overwhelming popular vote that it would make the false Democratic prophets
      and bolting Republican malcontents, if there were any, &ldquo;hunt the
      tall timber.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democratic press in reply had said that the editor of the <i>Herald</i>
      was whistling to keep up his courage, and of course much amusement had
      been caused by the spirited controversy. So when the eventful day arrived
      fully as many Democrats journeyed to Rawlins to see the fun as there were
      Republican delegates. Of course, as good Democrats, they lost no
      opportunity to help embitter the two factions and widen the breach between
      the Bragdon and the Carlisle forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Editor Earle Clemens, however, had ideas of his own that he told to no
      one. The electric light was shining in his room long after midnight and
      his small hand typewriter, which he always carried in his grip, was busy
      clicking away&mdash;presumably writing copy for the columns of his paper.
      What really occurred however, was this: He wrote two letters on the hotel
      stationery&mdash;one addressed to Hon. Ben Bragdon, and the other
      addressed to Hon. W. Henry Carlisle, and the envelopes were marked
      private.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the letters were duly typewritten, he placed an electric light under
      a pane of glass with which he had provided himself, elevating the glass by
      supporting the ends with a couple of books, and then from letters that he
      had at some former time received from both aspirants cleverly traced and
      signed the signature of W. Henry Carlisle to one letter and in like manner
      signed the signature of Ben Bragdon to the other letter&mdash;yes, brazen
      forgeries.
    </p>
    <p>
      After inclosing them in their respective envelopes, he stole softly out
      into the hallway and slipped one under the door of Carlisle&rsquo;s room
      and the other under the door of Bragdon&rsquo;s room. Then he went
      downstairs and bribed the night clerk to call both Bragdon and Carlisle at
      sharp fifteen minutes before six o&rsquo;clock. This done, Clemens
      hastened back to his own apartment for a few hours&rsquo; sleep, wondering
      as he disrobed if the &ldquo;end would justify the means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question,&rdquo; he said to himself as he climbed into
      the bed, &ldquo;but that the Republican ox is in the ditch and heroic
      measures are necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, when W. Henry Carlisle was awakened by the night
      clerk calling out softly the hour of seven o&rsquo;clock, he hastily arose
      and began dressing, but before he had half finished he spied the letter
      that had been pushed under his door. Picking it up, he broke the seal and
      this is what he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Carlisle:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It probably requires more bravery to make an apology and to ask to
      be forgiven than it does to settle differences between gentlemen by the
      now antiquated &lsquo;code.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I here and now tender my apologies for any unkind words I may in
      the past have spoken derogatory to you, and as an evidence of my candor
      will pledge you the support of myself and friends for both temporary and
      permanent chairman at tomorrow&rsquo;s convention, if you reciprocate this
      offer of a reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are big enough and broad enough and generous enough to
      accept this overture and desire to bury all past differences and from now
      on work in harmony together, each helping the other, as did Jonathan and
      David of old, why, the opportunity is offered, and we will let bygones be
      bygones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you accept this apology, meet me at the hotel bar early tomorrow
      morning and merely extend your hand of friendship in greeting. I will
      understand; but please do not humiliate me by mentioning the fact, even to
      your best friends, that I have written this letter, and above all do not
      refer to it at our meeting tomorrow morning or at any future time. It is
      quite enough if these old differences are wiped off the slate between you
      and myself without commenting, or permitting comments to be made. I am not
      unmindful, Carlisle, that you are a great big able man and I want you to
      be my friend, and I wish to be yours. You have the power to make my
      nomination for state senator unanimous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honor of subscribing myself
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Bragdon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the hall Ben Bragdon was also reading a letter, which was almost a
      duplicate of the one that Carlisle was perusing, except that the
      conditions were reversed. Carlisle, in his letter of apology, offered to
      support Bragdon for the nomination, provided the hatchet was buried and
      the Bragdon forces would support him for temporary and permanent chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the reading of these respective letters, each wore an
      exultant look of mastery on his face. For the time being at least all
      other differences were forgotten. In the hearts of both was the thought:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty decent of him; he really is a bigger man than I
      thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlisle was the first man to leave his room and going quickly downstairs
      passed hurriedly into the hotel bar, which at that early hour was deserted
      except for the immaculate, white-aproned bartender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will it be this morning, Mr. Carlisle?&rdquo; was the
      respectful inquiry of the attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing just yet,&rdquo; replied Carlisle, &ldquo;I am waiting for
      a friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Ben Bragdon came in, whereupon both of these skillful
      politicians vied in meeting each other more than half-way and extending
      the right hand of good fellowship in kindliest greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;re a little early,&rdquo; stammered Bragdon in a
      futile attempt to appear at ease and free from embarrassment. They both
      laughed a little, and Carlisle remarked that fortunately the bartender was
      at his post even if the delegates were slow about getting started on the
      day&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the night clerk appeared and apologized for calling them so
      early. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how it happened,&rdquo; he stammered,
      &ldquo;but I made a mistake of an hour. I called you gentlemen at six
      instead of seven. I hope you&rsquo;ll not&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; exclaimed Bragdon and Carlisle
      in unison, as they good-naturedly waved him aside with their assurance
      that they were glad to be up and about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of Martini cocktails,&rdquo; said Bragdon to the
      attendant. The cocktails were soon before them and tossed off in a jiffy,
      with the mutual salutation of &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come again, my man; make it half a dozen this time&mdash;three
      apiece,&rdquo; said Carlisle, laughing and throwing down a twenty dollar
      gold piece. &ldquo;Might as well have a good appetizer while we&rsquo;re
      about it, and then we&rsquo;ll relish our breakfast, good or bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They chatted about the weather while the cocktails were being prepared.
      Finally the cocktails were pushed along the bar counter, three in front of
      each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bragdon, as they each lifted a glass.
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to your good health!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Carlisle, &ldquo;but since we have three
      cocktails apiece before us, suppose we drink to the past, the present, and
      the future!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; replied Bragdon, beaming with approval. &ldquo;Splendid
      idea and happily put&rdquo; He then ordered some of the highest priced
      cigars the house afforded and insisted on Carlisle filling his pockets,
      while he stowed away a goodly number himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the fourth cocktail disappeared, they started for the
      dining-room arm in arm, chatting away to one another like two old cronies
      who had just met after a long separation. They found seats at a table in a
      far corner and in their eagerness to say the right thing to one another
      took no notice that a few of the delegates were already at tables in
      different parts of the room. The delegates laid down their knives and
      forks and looked toward Bragdon and Carlisle in astonishment. Then they
      whispered among themselves, whereupon four or five left the room quietly
      and hastened with all speed to carry word to the other delegates, most of
      whom were still in their apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news spread like wildfire, and a general scramble followed in
      hurriedly dressing and rushing downstairs to witness with their own eyes
      such an unexpected turn in political affairs between two men who had been
      at daggers drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a very short time the dining-room was well filled with delegates,
      but neither Bragdon nor Carlisle paid any attention; nor were they
      seemingly conscious that all eyes were turned upon them. Each was
      felicitating himself on the turn of events. Then, too, their amiability,
      as well as their appetites, had no doubt been whetted into keenest
      activity by the cocktails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Bragdon, after breakfast, gave orders that the Hon. W. Henry Carlisle
      was to be made both temporary and permanent chairman, and Carlisle
      likewise announced that the Hon. Ben Bragdon was to be nominated as
      senatorial candidate by acclamation; and each issued his instructions in
      such a matter-of-fact, yet stubbornly blunt fashion, that no one offered
      any objection or asked any questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delegates looked at each other, nudged one another in the ribs and
      indulged in many a sly wink of suppressed amusement. But they all quickly
      recognized the political advantage insured by a coalition of the Bragdon
      and Carlisle forces, and the utter dismay this would cause in the camp of
      the Democrats. Therefore they all became &ldquo;programme&rdquo; men and
      took their orders meekly. So when the convention finally met and got down
      to business with Carlisle presiding, it at once proceeded to nominate Ben
      Bragdon by a unanimous vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seemingly everybody cheered on the slightest provocation and everybody was
      in excellent good nature, and after the convention had completed its
      labors and adjourned, it was conceded to have been one of the most
      harmonious political gatherings ever held in the state. Thus was the
      prediction of Earle Clemens, the newspaper scribe, fulfilled to the very
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convention over, the delegates drifted back to the Ferris House and
      not long after Big Phil Lee called at Clemens&rsquo; room. The editor was
      picking away at his typewriter, preparing a report for the columns of his
      paper. Grant Jones, Roderick Warfield, and two or three others were in the
      room, smoking and talking. But Clemens paid no attention, so intent was he
      on his work. Big Phil Lee, who without doubt had been Bragdon&rsquo;s
      loudest shouter, said: &ldquo;Say, Clemens, I compliment you on your
      prophetic editorials. I reckon you are writing another one. You said the
      convention would be harmonious, and how in the demnition bow-wows your
      prophecy happened to come true nobody knows. But it did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Clemens, in his light-hearted jovial way,
      and then looking out of the window for a moment, added: &ldquo;I say, Lee,
      don&rsquo;t it beat hell what a little clever horse sense will accomplish
      at times in a political convention?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Big Phil, quickly. &ldquo;You
      seem to be posted. By gad! I think it&rsquo;s high time I was taken into
      the inner councils myself and had the seemingly inexplainable made clear
      to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; replied Clemens in a subdued voice, as he bit the
      tip of another cigar and struck a match. &ldquo;Neither Bragdon nor
      Carlisle has invited me into any of their secret conferences.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Phil Lee looked a bit incredulous, shook his head in a nonplussed sort
      of way and said: &ldquo;Well, so long, boys. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; down to
      the hotel parlor where Bragdon is holding his reception. They are falling
      over one another congratulating Carlisle about as much as they are
      Bragdon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed behind him, Clemens looked up from his typewriter and
      said to Grant Jones, laughingly: &ldquo;Say, Grant, remember what the Good
      Book says?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Says lots of things&mdash;what do you refer to?&rdquo; asked Grant
    </p>
    <p>
      Clemens replied: &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones came over close to him and said: &ldquo;Look here, Clemens.&rdquo;
      And he fixed him with his eyes as if searching for an answer to that which
      was veiled in mystery. But Clemens stood the ordeal and presently Jones
      burst out laughing: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Clemens, the <i>Herald</i>
      has sure put one over on the <i>Doublejack</i> this time. I don&rsquo;t
      know how it was done, and maybe I never will know. But take it from me, it
      was clever&mdash;damned clever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clemens made no reply, but removing his cigar winked at Roderick Warfield
      who was sitting near, puffed rings of smoke toward the ceiling and
      afterwards whistled softly the air of &ldquo;Wyoming,&rdquo; the state
      song, even while he smiled the smile of a knowledge that surpasses
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delegates and sightseers, Republicans and Democrats, who had journeyed to
      see a hotly contested nomination, ostensibly for the state senate but
      really for political supremacy, were good-natured and jovial when they
      started on the return trip. Big Phil Lee shouted to Earle Gemens who was
      on the other stage and said: &ldquo;We are such a happy family, I presume
      we will return on the same road instead of dividing and horse racing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clemens and the other returning passengers on the hurricane deck laughed
      good-naturedly and said: &ldquo;Sure, we will stick together from now on
      and fight the Democrats.&rdquo; Presently the crowd commenced singing
      vigorously&mdash;if a bunch of discordant voices could be so described&mdash;various
      popular airs of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening a reception was given Ben Bragdon at the hotel Bonhomme in
      Encampment, and the affair was presided over by W. Henry Carlisle. It was
      interpreted that the breach between these two attorneys had been
      effectually healed to the discomfiture of the Democrats. But no one save
      and except Earle Clemens knew how it had been brought about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick Warfield slipped away early from the scene of jubilation, and
      carried the glorious news to the Shields&rsquo; ranch that Ben Bragdon had
      been unanimously nominated. Barbara, with the flush of radiant joy on her
      face, could no longer deny the soft impeachment, and he boldly
      congratulated her on her coming wedding to the senator-elect for southern
      Wyoming.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;THE UPLIFTING OF HUMANITY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following
      evening Roderick called at the Major&rsquo;s home, and found a visitor
      there, a stranger yet very well known to him by reputation. This was no
      other than the Reverend Stephen Grannon, the travelling parson, of whose
      fame as a doer of good deeds at the cost of complete self-sacrifice and
      self-denial, Roderick had often heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to see you, Roderick,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Come
      right in. You know, of course, the most noted man in the camp&mdash;the
      man with the saddle bags. What? Never met yet? Well, it is a great
      pleasure to me to make you two acquainted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After cordial greetings had been exchanged Major Hampton continued:
      &ldquo;We have just been discussing some of the great problems of
      humanity. Pardon me, my dear friend, but I wish to say to Mr. Warfield
      that if I were called upon today to name the greatest humanitarian with
      whom I am acquainted I certainly should say&mdash;the Reverend Stephen
      Grannon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me too much honor,&rdquo; interposed the parson hastily.
      &ldquo;You compliment me far too highly.&rdquo; Major Hampton went on as
      if the Reverend Stephen Grannon had made no interruption: &ldquo;The
      school of humanitarianism is small in number, but the combined results of
      their labors directed through the channels of service in the behalf of
      humanity bear the stamp of greatness. The sincere lover of his fellows
      recognizes that the poor of this world have borne and are still bearing
      the burdens of the race. The poor have built all the monuments along the
      world&rsquo;s highway of civilization. They have produced all the wealth
      from the hills and from the soil The poor of the world have endured the
      hardships of conquering the wilds and erecting outposts on the border of
      civilization. Indeed they conquer everything except the fetters that bind
      them and hold them as an asset of great corporate power that is heartless
      and soulless and indifferent to the privations and sufferings of the
      individual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Stephen Grannon gave it as his view that the mission of a
      humanitarian was not to hinder the world&rsquo;s progress, nor even to
      prejudice anyone against the fortune gathering of the rich, but rather to
      dispell the darkness of injustice and assist the great army of the
      impoverished to a better understanding of their rights as well as their
      powers to conquer the evils that have throughout the ages crept into and
      clung to our civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poverty,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is the cause of much misery and
      often the impelling motive to immorality and crime in many forms. Men
      often sell and barter their votes and birthrights in this free country to
      bribe givers&mdash;wily politicians&mdash;while our girls are not
      infrequently lured into selling their very souls for ribbons and the
      gaudiness and shams of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the cure?&rdquo; asked Roderick, greatly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cure,&rdquo; responded the preacher, &ldquo;is the regeneration
      of mankind through the leavening and uplifting power of the principles
      taught by the humble humanitarian of Galilee, the great prince of
      righteousness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Major Hampton, &ldquo;the Reverend Stephen
      Grannon has given you the solution for the problem. Add to this a higher
      education. The more highly educated the individual,&rdquo; continued the
      Major, &ldquo;the greater the crime if they break the law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;this is a free country and we
      have free schools. Why do not the poor have a better education?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reverend Grannon turned quickly to Roderick and replied: &ldquo;You come
      with me to the twenty-odd mining camps, Mr. Warfield, surrounding this
      town of Encampment&mdash;come with me up in the hills where there are no
      schools&mdash;see the little children growing up in carelessness because
      of the impossibility on the part of their fathers and mothers to provide
      them with school privileges. In the school room the teacher becomes the
      overseer not alone of their studies but of their morals as well. Let me
      take you down in the mines,&rdquo; he continued, speaking with great
      earnestness, &ldquo;and see the boys from twelve years to twenty-one years
      working day after day, many of them never having had school privileges and
      therefore unable to read or write.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for just a moment, then resumed: &ldquo;It brings to my mind
      what a very wise man once wrote. It was King Solomon, and among many other
      splendid truths he said: &lsquo;The rich man&rsquo;s wealth is his strong
      city; the destruction of the poor is their poverty.&rsquo;.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick,&rdquo; said the Major as he lit his meerschaum and blew
      the smoke towards the ceiling, &ldquo;my heart is very light tonight, for
      I have arranged with the assistance of the Reverend Stephen Grannon to
      help relieve this lamentable situation in those mining camps up in the
      mountains away from school privileges. I have recently taken the matter up
      with the county commissioners and have agreed to build twenty
      schoolhouses. Each schoolhouse will consist of two rooms. One will be for
      the smaller children during the day and also to serve as a night school
      for the young men and young women who are employed in manual labor during
      working hours. The other room is a library sufficiently large and spacious
      to accommodate the young men of each mining community and thus keep them
      away from saloons, brothels, and prize ring attractions. One hour each
      evening will be taken up by a reader and a regular course of entertaining
      books will be read aloud in a serial way. The books in the library will be
      loaned out on tickets and the usual library rules observed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;that sounds practical to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is practical,&rdquo; said the Reverend Stephen Grannon, &ldquo;and
      thanks to Major Buell Hampton this plan which I have cherished for so many
      years will soon be put into effect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at his watch he turned to the Major and said: &ldquo;By the way,
      Major, I have a couple of poor families to visit tonight. I have promised
      them, and they will be disappointed if I do not come.&rdquo; He arose as
      he said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; replied Buell Hampton, &ldquo;I am sorry you
      cannot remain longer with us, but I would not keep you from your duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Stephen Grannon put on his top coat, as the evenings were
      growing chilly, and after shaking hands took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone and the door closed, Major Hampton turned to Roderick and
      holding up one hand said reverently: &ldquo;Of such is the kingdom of
      heaven. In all my lifetime, Roderick, I have never known another such
      splendid character. I have closely observed his work ever since I came to
      this camp. Perhaps in his entire lifetime he has not collected fifty
      dollars in money. He says he does not want money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must have money to live on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all money considerations,&rdquo; said the Major, looking into
      the darkened corner of his living room, &ldquo;he wants to save souls here
      on this earth so that he will have more jewels in his crown over yonder&mdash;these
      are his own words. There is not a family in the surrounding country that
      he is not acquainted with. If there is sickness he is the first one there.
      Where the greatest poverty abounds you will find him. He goes out and
      solicits alms for those in distress, but keeps nothing for himself
      excepting the frailest living. Go through the valley or up in the mountain
      gorges or still farther up in the mining camps where the snow never melts
      from the shady side of the log cabins, and you will find this noble
      character, Reverend Stephen Grannon, doing his good work for the poor&mdash;ministering
      to their wants and endeavoring to lift humanity into higher walks,
      physically, morally, and spiritually.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you have told me all this,&rdquo; replied Roderick.
      &ldquo;It increases my already high opinion of the parson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a veritable shepherd among the people,&rdquo; continued Major
      Hampton. &ldquo;Reverend Grannon is the true flockmaster of Wyoming. The
      people are frequently unruly, boisterous, intemperate and immoral, yet he
      treats them with greatest consideration and seeks to persuade and lead
      them away from their sins and transgressions. Yes, he is a great
      flockmaster&mdash;he is well named The Flockmaster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were silent for a few moments. Then the Major, as if suddenly
      remembering something, looked up and said: &ldquo;He tells me Scotty
      Meisch is getting along fine over in the <i>Dillon Doublejack</i> printing
      office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear that,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick. &ldquo;It is
      good to have saved at least one lad from going the way of those outlaws of
      Jack Creek. I have never forgotten that ghastly midnight scene&mdash;the
      massacred sheep and the burning herders&rsquo; wagons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can you expect?&rdquo; asked the Major. &ldquo;When the
      social waters are poisoned at the fountain head, the whole course of the
      stream becomes pernicious. In this state of Wyoming the standard of
      political decency is not high. The people have no real leaders to look up
      to. The United States Senator, F. E. Greed, sets a pernicious example to
      the rising generation. He violates laws in scores of instances because of
      his greed and grafting proclivities, and his bribed supporters go on year
      after year supporting him. What the state needs is a leader. High-minded
      leaders are priceless. Their thoughts and their deeds are the richest
      legacy to a state or a community. Great leaders are beacon lights kindled
      upon the mountain peaks of the centuries, illuminating the mental and
      moral atmosphere of civilization. The history of the world&mdash;of a
      nation, of a state and of a community&mdash;is the story of their epochal
      deeds, while man&rsquo;s advancement is only the lengthened shadow of
      their moral, spiritual and temporal examples. Leaders come up from the
      crowd, from among the poor and the lowly. They are immediately recognized
      by the great mass of the people and invariably crowned, although sometimes
      it is a crown of thorns that they are compelled to wear and endure for
      upholding priceless principles in their endeavor to lead humanity to a
      higher plane. However,&rdquo; concluded the Major, &ldquo;the world is
      growing better. The nimble-fingered, tilltapping, porch-climbing derelicts
      in politics and commercialism are becoming unpopular. The reprehensible
      methods in all avenues of life are being condemned instead of condoned&mdash;the
      goats are being cast out from among the sheep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You interest me very much, Major,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;Your
      ideals are so high, your aims so decent and right, that it is a pleasure
      to hear you talk. I am a firm believer,&rdquo; Roderick went on, &ldquo;in
      the justice of the doctrine that all men are created free and equal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sad commentary,&rdquo; replied Major Hampton, &ldquo;in
      this land where liberty is cherished and our Government corner-stoned upon
      the theory that all men are free and equal, that even the soberest of us
      are compelled, my dear Roderick, to regard such affirmations as
      blasphemous. To illustrate: An employee in one of the big manufacturing
      combinations committed a burglary&mdash;almost petty larceny in its
      smallness&mdash;another case of Jean Valjean stealing bread for his
      children&mdash;and yet he was tried before an alleged court of justice and
      sent to the penitentiary for ten years. The head of the same institution
      pillaged multiplied millions from the poor in unjust and lawless
      extortions. When he was caught red-handed in his lawbreaking, instead of
      sharing a prison cell with the poor man our courts indulgently permitted
      this great highwayman six months&rsquo; time in which to reorganize and
      have legalized his methods of stealing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such rank injustice,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, &ldquo;makes my
      blood tingle with indignation. It is surely high time a determined crusade
      was led against the privileged classes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major made no reply but after a little, looking up from the open grate
      and turning to Roderick, he asked him if he was aware that the next day
      was the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Encampment Mine and
      Smelting Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it?&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;Some time ago I noticed
      something in the newspapers about the meeting, but as it was of no
      particular moment to me I had forgotten it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Major Hampton, &ldquo;and I guess I will now tell
      you that I have been holding a secret from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember,&rdquo; the Major went on, &ldquo;that I left you
      in Denver after we made the big ore shipment and that I was away for three
      or four weeks. Well, I went to New York, employed two or three big brokers
      down on Wall Street, and commenced buying Encampment Mine and Smelter
      Company stock on the exchange. Working jointly with a new friend I have
      discovered, a professional man of finance yet a true friend of humanity, I
      have absolute control of the stock today.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have?&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick. &ldquo;You own a control of
      the stock in this great smelter and the Ferris-Haggerty mine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the whole enterprise is virtually in our ownership. Well,
      something is going to happen tomorrow at the stockholders&rsquo; meeting
      which I fear will not be pleasant to certain individuals. But duty compels
      me to pursue a course I have mapped out. My chosen work in life is to
      serve the poor, yet in trying to fulfill this mission I harbor no
      resentful thoughts against the rich as a class nor do I intend for them
      any unfair treatment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the people only knew,&rdquo; remarked Roderick, softly, &ldquo;you
      are without doubt one of the richest men in this part of the country and
      yet you so honestly prefer the simple life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two kinds of rich people,&rdquo; continued the Major.
      &ldquo;One class is arrogant and unfeeling; they hoard money by fair means
      or foul for money&rsquo;s sake and for the power it brings. The other
      class use their wealth not to oppress but to relieve the worthy poor.
      Personally, Warfield, I do not regard the money which accident has made
      mine as being in any sense a personal possession. Rather do I hold it as a
      trust fund. Of course I am grateful. The money enlarges my opportunity to
      do things for my fellows that I wish to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major paused a moment, then resumed: &ldquo;Do you remember, Roderick,
      when I first told you, Jim Rankin and the others about my hidden mine that
      I said there were six men in the world whom I held in highest esteem?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember well,&rdquo; assented Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, five of you were present then&mdash;Tom Sun, Boney Earnest,
      and Grant Jones, with yourself and Jim. For the absent sixth one I
      specifically reserved a share in my prosperity, although at the time I
      withheld his name. Now you know it He is the one entitled to most
      consideration among us all&mdash;the Reverend Stephen Grannon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is,&rdquo; concurred Roderick, with hearty conviction.
      &ldquo;He can do more good in the world than all the rest of us together,
      yourself excepted, Major.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present, perhaps,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton. &ldquo;But let his
      shining example be an incentive to you all&mdash;to us all. Well, in a
      confidential way, I will tell you, Roderick, that when in New York I also
      purchased a large block of bonds that yields an income of something like
      $20,000 per year. This income I have legally turned over with proper
      writings to the Reverend Stephen Grannon, and already I think you will
      discover a vast improvement in the mining camps and throughout the valleys
      among the poor. For Stephen Grannon is a godly man and a true
      humanitarian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, but that&rsquo;s great&mdash;that&rsquo;s grand!&rdquo;
      murmured Roderick with deep enthusiasm. And he gazed at Buell Hampton&rsquo;s
      noble soul-lit face admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major rose to his feet&mdash;his usual method of intimating that he
      wished to be alone. Roderick grasped his hand, and would have spoken
      further, but Buell Hampton interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, my dear boy. I am glad that you have been interested
      in what I had to say tonight. The veil was lifted and you saw me as I am&mdash;anxious
      to be of benefit to my fellows. I shall indeed be proud if you find these
      doctrines not merely acceptable to yourself, but in some degree at least
      stimulative in your acts toward the worthy poor and lowly as the years
      come and go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick walked slowly along the street deep in thought over Buell
      Hampton&rsquo;s words, he came suddenly upon W. B. Grady and several well
      dressed strangers at a street corner. The visitors, he surmised, were
      eastern directors of the big smelting company who had come to Encampment
      for the stockholders&rsquo; meeting on the morrow.

      CHAPTER XXVIII.&mdash;JUSTICE FOR THE WORKERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next morning at
      ten o&rsquo;clock, Major Buell
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampton walked down to the smelter office. He was met at the door of the
      directors&rsquo; room by the general manager, Mr. W. B. Grady. Despite a
      bold front Grady looked careworn and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on there,&rdquo; he said as the Major started to enter.
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; He spoke roughly. &ldquo;This is a meeting
      of some gentlemen who are interested in the Smelter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I came down to attend the
      stockholders&rsquo; meeting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t go in,&rdquo; said Grady. &ldquo;Stockholders&rsquo;
      meetings of this company are private. We do not furnish entertainment and
      gossip for onlookers like a justice of the peace court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may all be true&mdash;I hope it is true, Mr. Grady,&rdquo;
      said the Major, and he looked him in the eyes with more of pity than of
      anger depicted on his face. The crafty manager cringed before the critical
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here strictly on business,&rdquo; continued Buell Hampton.
      &ldquo;I am a stockholder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a stockholder in our Smelter Company?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have that honor,&rdquo; replied the Major, tersely. &ldquo;Or at
      least I hold powers of attorney from the largest group of stockholders in
      your company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An ashen grey crept into Grady&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;You are not a
      shareholder of record on our books.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you will find as shareholders of record the names of
      Charles T. Brown, George Edward Reed, Herbert Levy, Daniel W. Higbee, and
      a few others about whom I need not bother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A new light broke over Grady. He looked more sickly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are recent purchasers of stock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in New
      York and also, if I remember rightly, in Iowa.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, and together these buyers now hold the controlling
      interest in your company. Here are the legal documents constituting me the
      attorney for all these men.&rdquo; He drew a neat little packet of papers
      from the breast pocket of his coat. &ldquo;In other words I am these men&mdash;I
      hold the controlling power, although I did not choose to disclose the fact
      until this morning. Now, will you please let me pass? Thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If a pistol had been thrust against the ribs of W. B. Grady, he could not
      have looked more utterly scared. He had stepped aside to let the Major
      pass and now bluff and bluster changed swiftly to sycophancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Major Hampton,&rdquo; he said, in his most ingratiating
      manner. &ldquo;Walk right in and let me introduce you to some of the other
      stockholders. Of course, only a few of them are here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major followed him into the directors&rsquo; room and was duly
      presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Grady with patronizing suavity, &ldquo;is an old
      fellow townsman of ours here in Encampment and a friend of mine. Here,
      Major, take this chair,&rdquo; insisted Grady. &ldquo;You see we are all a
      happy family together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton could not but contrast the fawning manner of the general
      manager before his superiors, the directors of the Company, with his
      notoriously overbearing and insolent treatment of the workingmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;fortunately we have a very
      good manager.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Grady with increased affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself, I am pleased and delighted at the general manager&rsquo;s
      report which I presume it will be in order now to have read. I think we
      have all seen it in advance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major shook his head in dissent but made no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the meeting was called to order, and after the preliminaries
      were concluded Mr. W. B. Grady proceeded to read a rather brief but very
      interesting annual report.
    </p>
    <p>
      His report was not only a business summary of a most successful fiscal
      year, but also abounded with more or less veiled laudations of himself in
      his capacity of manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attorney Wm. Henry Carlisle, who combined with his legal position a seat
      on the board of directors, advised that the election of a directorate for
      the ensuing year was in order. By this time it was known to the other
      shareholders present that Major Buell Hampton owned or represented a
      control of the stock. This rather upset the cut-and-dried program.
    </p>
    <p>
      W. B. Grady, addressing the chairman, said that he presumed Major Buell
      Hampton would appreciate being elected a member of the board of directors,
      and if the Company&rsquo;s attorney, Mr. Carlisle, did not object perhaps
      it would be well for him to vacate his seat so as to make room for the new
      incumbent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlisle&rsquo;s face grew very red at this attempted slight but he said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Buell Hampton arose, and addressing the chairman said: &ldquo;Since
      I have acquired control of the stock of this Company, I have decided that
      Mr. Grady shall not be re-elected as a director. But in the first place I
      wish to ask of all stockholders present what their intentions are
      regarding the declaring of a dividend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this he resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      By every lineament on Grady&rsquo;s face one could see that he was
      furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;that it would be proper
      to follow the suggestion of Mr. Grady, our general manager, and declare a
      dividend of seventy-two per cent on the capital stock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Buell Hampton, again addressing the chair, remarked that seventy-two
      per cent, was certainly a fat dividend. But for himself he had purchased a
      control of the Company&rsquo;s stock for the purpose of introducing some
      innovations in its management, and in order that there might be no
      misunderstanding he felt it was now proper to present his views. If any of
      the directors were not in harmony, why, of course, it would be inadvisable
      for them to stand for re-election to a directorate over which he intended
      henceforth to exercise a close supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now wish to ask the directors of the Company this question,&rdquo;
      added the Major. &ldquo;What about Boney Earnest&rsquo;s dividend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the stockholders and representatives of stockholders present
      seemed almost dumfounded. They turned to the manager, Mr. Grady, who
      answered the Major by saying he did not know that Boney Earnest, the
      dismissed blast furnace foreman, was a stockholder or had any investment
      in the concern&mdash;&ldquo;it was all news to him,&rdquo; he added with a
      weak attempt at levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton had remained standing, and by silent consent all waited for
      him to reply to this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;Boney Earnest may
      not be a stockholder of record. But all the same he had his all invested
      in this smelting plant. Day after day, during year after year, he stood
      before the blast furnace, doing work of a class which few men could
      endure. It is true he received a daily wage until the date of his
      dismissal, but he had invested in addition to his daily duties almost a
      life-time of ripe experience in the particular work he was doing for this
      concern. In short, he had his all&mdash;his strength, his brain and his
      experience&mdash;invested. In these circumstances I object,&rdquo;
      continued Major Hampton, &ldquo;to a dividend of seventy-two per cent. I
      notice from the manager&rsquo;s report that he has made ample allowances
      for betterments, replacements, and surplus, and even with all these very
      proper provisions, the enormous possible dividend of seventy-two per cent,
      still remains. An original capital stock of $500,000 and an annual
      dividend of $360,000, certainly is a magnificent showing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton paused and all present clapped their hands gleefully, as if
      the Major was coming around to their way of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      After silence was restored he proceeded: &ldquo;Money is worth probably
      from five per cent, to six per cent, per annum on solid, non-hazardous
      investments and at least double these figures or more on mining
      investments which must be regarded as extremely hazardous. It is not,
      however, worth seventy-two per cent. per annum. Therefore, gentlemen, we
      will declare a dividend of six per cent, on the capital stock, which will
      require $30,000. We will then add the capital stock to the pay roll. The
      pay roll for the last year in round numbers is $1,100,000. The capital
      stock is $500,000 or a total of both of $1,600,000. We will then declare
      the remaining $330,000 of earnings into a dividend on the entire
      $1,600,000 of capital stock and annual pay roll combined, which amounts to
      a little over twenty per cent. This will give to the shareholders of our
      company&rsquo;s stock a little more than a twenty-six per cent, dividend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major sat down. Consternation was apparent on every countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; said one of the eastern directors, &ldquo;may I ask
      you what would happen and what you would do in carrying out your
      altruistic dream if the earnings did not amount to even six per cent, on
      the money actually invested?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major arose again and with great politeness replied: &ldquo;Probably
      we would not declare a dividend. If we had but $30,000 that could be
      legitimately applied to dividend purposes, the amount would belong to the
      stockholders. But anything above this preferred dividend to the
      shareholders should be declared on the annual pay roll combined with and
      added to the capital stock of the company, both classes of investors
      participating in the surplus over and above six per cent, preferred
      dividend. The question with me,&rdquo; added the Major, &ldquo;is this?
      How many of you directors are in sympathy with the suggestion I have made?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There came no answer, and he continued: &ldquo;A while ago I expressed
      myself against your manager for a position on the directorate. I always
      have a reason for my decisions. It has come to me,&rdquo; continued the
      Major, &ldquo;that while the original cost of this plant may have been
      $500,000 yet by the wicked manipulation of the &lsquo;system&rsquo; the
      original shareholders were completely frozen out&mdash;legally robbed if
      you please, of their investment and it is quite probable the Pennsylvania
      crowd, the present owners or at least those who were the owners before I
      purchased a control, paid very little in real money but much in duplicity
      and ripened experience in the ways of the fox and the jackal. I have
      learned on excellent authority that Mr. W. B. Grady, by stealth and
      cunning, secured the underlying bonds from one of the former builders of
      this great plant, and robbed him and left him penniless in his old age.
      Unless other means of restitution be devised, the reimbursing of those
      stolen sums out of my private purse will be one of my first duties and one
      of my greatest pleasures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grady rose, his face flushed with passion. But Buell Hampton waved him
      down with his hand and calmly proceeded: &ldquo;I will state another
      innovation. There are seven directors who control the destinies of this
      company. I now insist that the company&rsquo;s attorney shall be
      instructed to have the by-laws so amended that the head of each
      department, beginning at the mine where we extract the ore, then the
      tramway which carries the ore to the smelter and all the various
      departments in the smelter including the converter&mdash;shall be elected
      annually by the workers themselves in each of the seven departments. In
      this way there will be seven foremen; and these seven foremen shall be
      officially recognized by the amended by-laws of this company as an
      advisory board of directors, entitled to sit and vote with the regular
      directors at each monthly meeting and likewise with the stockholders in
      their annual meeting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a bomb-shell been thrown into the stockholders&rsquo; meeting greater
      consternation could not have been evinced&rsquo;. Finally Attorney
      Carlisle moved that an adjournment be taken until ten o&rsquo;clock the
      next day, at which time the stockholders would re-assemble and further
      consider the unexpected and doubtless vital questions now under
      consideration. The motion prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the entire matter hinged first of all upon the election of a
      directorate. During the adjournment Attorney Carlisle, peeved at Grady&rsquo;s
      readiness to drop him from the directorate, called on Major Hampton and
      assured him he was in accord with the views he had expressed and that his
      every suggestion could be legally complied with by amending the by-laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton, however, did not take the hint implied. He was courteous
      but firm. The old régime had to go&mdash;the management must be changed,
      lock, stock and barrel. Therefore there could be no further utilization of
      Mr. Carlisle&rsquo;s services as attorney for the company. Baffled and
      discomfited the lawyer withdrew. He was full of indignation, not against
      Major Hampton, but against Grady, for he had warned the latter against
      selling a certain block of stock to part with which had jeopardized
      control of the corporation. But Grady, in need of money, had replied that
      there was no risk, the buying being sporadic and the existing directorate
      in high favor with the stockholders because of its ability and readiness
      to vote big dividends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grady had little dreamed that already considerable blocks of the stock had
      passed, under various names, into the control of the Keokuk banker, Allen
      Miller, to whom he had some time before mortgaged his Mine and Smelter
      Company bonds, and who had reasons of his own for displacing Grady and
      crippling him still more badly in his finances. Nor had he sensed the
      danger that the scattered sales of stock in the East had been in reality
      for a single buyer, Major Buell Hampton. Therefore he had been caught
      quite unprepared for the combination of forces that was able now to throw
      him down and out at the first meeting of stockholders. For once the fox
      had slept and had been caught napping in the short grass, away from the
      tall timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlisle had of late been too busy &ldquo;doing politics,&rdquo; and had
      allowed matters to drift even though he had seen possible rocks ahead. Now
      the two old-time confederates were blaming each other&mdash;Carlisle
      denouncing Grady for parting with the stock control, Grady upbraiding
      Carlisle for neglect in not having taken steps to discover who were the
      real buyers of the shares being gradually transferred on the company&rsquo;s
      stock books. The blow, however, had fallen, and there was no means of
      blocking the transfer of power into new hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the stockholders&rsquo; meeting reconvened the following morning,
      Major Buell Hampton submitted the names of five men whom he desired on the
      directorate. They were&mdash;Roderick Warfield, Grant Jones, Boney Earnest
      and himself, together with Ben Bragdon, who would also take up the duties
      of attorney for the company. This left only a couple of places to be
      filled by the eastern stockholders. Two names from among the old directors
      were offered and accepted. Indeed the selection of directors became a
      unanimous affair, for seeing themselves utterly defeated both Grady and
      Carlisle, glaring at each other, had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton&rsquo;s views on corporations and dividends, and his new
      plan of management for the Smelter Company spread all over the camp with
      astonishing rapidity, and there was general rejoicing among the miners and
      laborers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One employee in the smelter who had been with the company for some three
      years made the discovery that, while he was receiving three dollars per
      day, which meant an annual income to himself and family of $1095, his
      dividend would bring him an extra lump sum of $219 annually.
    </p>
    <p>
      When figuring this out to his wife he said: &ldquo;Think of the pairs of
      shoes it will buy for our kiddies, Bess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the woman, an Irishwoman, had replied: &ldquo;Bless the little darlin&rsquo;s.
      And hats and coats as well, not to speak of ribbons for the girls. God
      bless the Major. Sure but he&rsquo;s a wonderful man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Several workers sitting in a corner of the Red Dog saloon were calculating
      with pencil and paper their annual dividends on the already famous Buell
      Hampton plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said one of them after they had their several accounts
      figured to the penny, &ldquo;maybe we won&rsquo;t make the dividend bigger
      next year&mdash;what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; responded another. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do at
      least twice the work every day of the coming year, because there&rsquo;s
      now an object for us poor devils to keep busy all the time. We&rsquo;re
      sharing in the profits, that&rsquo;s just what it means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a great reduction in breakage and waste,&rdquo;
      remarked another employee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The directors can leave it to us to make the next year&rsquo;s
      dividend a dandy one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These were just a few of the grateful encomiums flying around.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day following the stockholders&rsquo; meeting the newly elected
      directors convened, all except Grant Jones, who was over at Dillon and had
      not yet been advised of his election. After Major Buell Hampton had been
      voted into the chair a communication from W. B. Grady was read, stating
      that he wished to know at once if the directors desired his services for
      the ensuing year; if so he required a written contract, and should the
      directors not be ready to comply with this ultimatum they could interpret
      this letter as a formal resignation. There was a general smile around the
      directors&rsquo; table at this bluffing acceptance of the inevitable. It
      was promptly moved, seconded, and carried unanimously that Mr. W. B. Grady
      be at once relieved from all further connection with the Smelter Company&rsquo;s
      plant and business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton then explained that in accordance with his scheme the men in
      the various departments would be invited at an early date to elect their
      foremen, and these foremen in turn would have the power, not to elect a
      general manager, but to recommend one for the final consideration of the
      directors. Until a permanent appointment was made he suggested that Boney
      Earnest, the blast furnace foreman dismissed by the late manager because
      of a personal quarrel, should take charge of the plant, he being a man of
      tried experience and worthy of absolute trust. This suggestion was
      promptly turned into a substantive motion and adopted by formal
      resolution. The meeting adjourned after Director Bragdon in his capacity
      as company attorney had been instructed to proceed immediately to the work
      of preparing the proper amendments to the by-laws and taking all legal
      steps necessary to put into operation the new plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus neither mine nor smelting plant was shut down, but everything went on
      without interruption and with greater vigor than before the momentous
      meetings of stockholders and directors. The only immediate visible effect
      of the company&rsquo;s radical change in policy was Grady&rsquo;s
      deposition from the post which had enabled him to exercise a cruel tyranny
      over the workingmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the solitude of his home the dismissed manager, broken financially
      although those around him did not yet know it, was nursing schemes of
      revenge against Buell Hampton, the man of mystery who had humiliated him
      and ousted him from power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was his henchman, Bud Bledsoe?&mdash;that was the question throbbing
      in Grady&rsquo;s brain. But Bud Bledsoe was now an outlaw among the hills,
      with a price on his head and a sheriff&rsquo;s posse ready at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice to get on his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, I&rsquo;ve got to find him,&rdquo; muttered Grady. And that
      night, in the falling dusk, he rode out alone into the mountain
      fastnesses.

      CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;SLEIGH BELLS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE morning after
      the directors&rsquo; meeting, when Roderick awakened and looked out of the
      window, he found the air filled with flakes of falling snow. He wasted no
      time over his toilet. Immediately after breakfast he bundled up snugly and
      warmly, went over to the livery stable and engaged a team and a sleigh.
      Soon after, the horses decorated with the best string of sleigh bells the
      livery could provide, he was holding the reins taut and sailing down
      through the main street of the little mining town headed for the country.
      He was going to the Shields ranch. Half a dozen invitations had been
      extended him during the past weeks, and he told himself he had been
      neglectful of his old employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the ranch and his team was duly stabled, the sleigh run in
      out of the storm, he was cordially welcomed by the family before a roaring
      fire of cheerfulness, and a multitude of questions were poured upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not come sooner and what about Major Hampton and the
      smelter? We have heard all sorts of wonderful things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what have you heard about the Major?&rdquo; inquired Roderick,
      endeavoring to get a lead to the things that had evoked such surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;Papa heard of it the
      day before yesterday when he was in town. The stockholders were having a
      meeting, and people said it had turned out to the surprise of everyone
      that Major Hampton was the owner of a control of the company&rsquo;s
      stock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Roderick, &ldquo;the rumor is correct. Great
      things have indeed happened. But haven&rsquo;t you heard from Ben Bragdon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose he has been too busy reconstructing the by-laws and
      the company&rsquo;s affairs generally. Major Hampton has put him in as
      attorney. There&rsquo;s a financial plum for you, Miss Barbara.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Carlisle?&rdquo; she asked in great astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like W. B. Grady, he is down and out,&rdquo; replied Roderick.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a clean sweep. And behold in me a full-blossomed
      member of the board of directors. Our chairman, the Major, has handed me
      over a small library of books about smelting of ores, company management,
      and so on. He tells me I&rsquo;ve got to get busy and learn the business&mdash;that
      I&rsquo;m slated as vice-president and assistant manager, or something of
      that kind. What do you think of all that, Mr. Shields? There&rsquo;s a
      rise in the world for your cowboy and broncho-buster of a few months ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cattle king and all the others warmly congratulated Roderick on his
      rising fortunes. Dorothy now took the lead in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You folks, keep still a moment until I ask Mr. Warfield just one
      question,&rdquo; she said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, quickly, &ldquo;I can answer the
      question. No, Grant Jones has not been over to Encampment for quite a
      while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A general laugh followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a devil over at his office,&rdquo; added Roderick gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo; they exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A devil. You surely know what a devil in a printing office is? It
      is a young fellow who washes the ink from the rolls and cleans the type or
      something of that sort&mdash;sweeps out, makes fires and does a wholesale
      janitor business. If he is faithful for fifteen or twenty years, then he
      learns to set type and becomes a printer. Grant is breaking his new devil
      in. Scotty Meisch, formerly one of your father&rsquo;s cowboys, is his
      name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, little Scotty,&rdquo; exclaimed Barbara. &ldquo;I remember him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, does that necessarily keep Grant away?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, he is not necessarily kept away. He is probably a believer,
      Miss Dorothy, that absence makes the heart grow fonder.&rsquo; I was very
      disappointed,&rdquo; Roderick went hurriedly on, smiling, &ldquo;that
      Grant was not in town to share the sleigh with me in coming over this
      morning. Of course he doesn&rsquo;t know it yet, but he also has been
      elected as one of the directors of the Encampment Mine and Smelter
      Company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has?&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy, her face lighting: &ldquo;My
      word, but he&rsquo;ll be all puffed up, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Roderick, &ldquo;Grant is a very sensible
      fellow and he selects his friends and associates with marked
      discrimination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; concurred Dorothy
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not a little embarrassed by a second ebullition of general
      laughter. There was a flush of rising color on her pretty cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she added bravely. &ldquo;If I
      like anybody I let them know about it, and that&rsquo;s all there is to be
      said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While luncheon was in progress, Roderick suggested that as the sleighing
      was very good and his sleigh a very large one&mdash;the seat exceedingly
      wide&mdash;the young ladies should come sleigh-riding with him in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; shouted the sisters in unison. &ldquo;Certainly,
      we will be delighted provided mother has no objections.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Shields, good-naturedly. &ldquo;This first
      snow of the season makes me feel like having a sleigh-ride myself. But,
      there, your seat certainly won&rsquo;t take four of us, and I know that
      Mr. Shields is too busy to think of getting out his sleigh this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;LL tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Mrs. Shields,&rdquo;
      said Roderick, stirring his coffee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you for a ride
      first. We will go as far as the river and back again, and then if the
      young ladies are real good why of course I&rsquo;ll give them the next
      spin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Shields, &ldquo;you young people go on and
      have your sleigh ride and a good time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; objected Barbara. &ldquo;You shall have the first sleigh
      ride, Mama, and if you don&rsquo;t go then Dorothy and I stay at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, Mrs. Shields,&rdquo; urged Roderick, &ldquo;accept my
      invitation, for I see if you don&rsquo;t I shall not be able to persuade
      the young ladies to come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;it is just lovely of him
      to invite you, and certainly the sleigh ride will be invigorating. The
      truth is, we girls will enjoy the ride afterwards doubly if we know you
      have had the first ride of the season before we have ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Shields, &ldquo;since you all insist,
      so let it be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Roderick&rsquo;s team was hitched to the sleigh and came
      jingling down to the front gate. Mrs. Shields was tucked snugly in under
      the robes and away they dashed with sleigh bells jingling, down the road
      towards the Platte River several miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got back Barbara and Dorothy were in readiness, and Roderick
      started away with them amid much merry laughter and promises from the
      girls to be home when they got home but not before. The snow was still
      falling in great big flakes and the cushion beneath the runners was soft
      and thick. Mile followed mile, and it was late in the afternoon when the
      sleighing party found themselves in Encampment. Roderick insisted that the
      young ladies should have supper at the Hotel Bonhomme; they would start on
      the return trip home immediately afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sleigh drove up to the hotel, who should be looking out of the
      front door but Grant Jones? He rushed outside and assisted the sisters to
      alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be back in a few minutes,&rdquo; shouted Roderick, as he
      dashed away to the livery stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Joe,&rdquo; said Roderick while the horses were being
      unhitched, &ldquo;I will want the rig again after dinner, and Grant Jones
      will also want a sleigh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied the stableman. &ldquo;I can fix him out
      all right and everything will be in readiness. Just telephone and I&rsquo;ll
      send the rip over to the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dinner table Grant Jones was at his best. He had already heard
      about the Smelter Company affairs and his own election as a director, and
      waved the topic aside. It was the surprise of seeing Dorothy that filled
      him with good-humor and joviality. As the meal progressed he turned to
      Roderick and said: &ldquo;Oh, yes, Roderick, I&rsquo;ve just been hearing
      from Scotty Meisch that during the summer months you learned to be a great
      trout fisherman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Roderick with a smile, &ldquo;I certainly had a
      great trout-fishing experience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Barbara quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the South Fork of the Encampment River.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Roderick Warfield,&rdquo; said Barbara quite emphatically,
      &ldquo;I invited you to go trout fishing with me a good many times, and
      you told me I should be the one to teach you the gentle art. Instead of
      this you go away and learn to catch trout all alone. How many did you
      catch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick reddened with embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-six,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was a pretty good catch for a novice. How big were they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two pounds,&rdquo; Roderick answered, absent-mindedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant Jones was fairly choking with laughter. &ldquo;I say, Barbara,&rdquo;
      he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go trout fishing alone,&rdquo; interrupted Roderick
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Barbara,&rdquo; persisted Grant, calling to her across
      the table. But Barbara was all attention to Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who went with you?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Gail Holden,&rdquo; he replied and his face was actually
      crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara laid down her knife and fork and leaned back in her chair, placed
      her arms akimbo with her pretty hands on her slender waist line, and
      looked at Roderick as if she were an injured child. Finally she said:
      &ldquo;Trifler!&rdquo; Then everybody laughed at Roderick&rsquo;s
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he quickly recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trifler yourself!&rdquo; he laughed back in rejoinder. &ldquo;What
      about Ben Bragdon? What would he have said had we gone trout-fishing
      together?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not out of the running then,&rdquo; said Barbara archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I was, although the secret was to be kept until after the
      nomination for senator.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Barbara&rsquo;s turn now to blush. She looked around in some
      bewilderment. Grant had bestowed a vigorous kick on Roderick&rsquo;s shins
      beneath the table. Only then did Roderick realize that he had broken a
      confidence. Dorothy was eyeing Grant reproachfully. It was a case of
      broken faith all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you sisters have no secrets from each other,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Roderick, meeting the situation with a bright smile. &ldquo;In just the
      same way Grant and I are chums and brothers. Besides it was a friendly
      warning. I was saved in time from the danger of shattered hopes and a
      broken heart, Miss Barbara.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So went fishing for consolation,&rdquo; she replied with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And found it,&rdquo; laughed Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says that?&rdquo; demanded Roderick, sternly. &ldquo;Miss
      Holden would have every reason seriously to object.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil says it,&rdquo; replied Grant, assuming a grave
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a poor joke,&rdquo; said Roderick, offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Scotty Meisch is an observant lad,&rdquo; remarked the editor
      drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The printer&rsquo;s devil!&rdquo; cried Dorothy, clapping her
      hands. And all four laughed heartily&mdash;Roderick most heartily of all
      despite his momentary dudgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then since all these whispers are going about,&rdquo; remarked
      Barbara when quiet was restored, &ldquo;I think it will be advisable for
      me to have a heart-to-heart talk with Gail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; faltered Roderick. &ldquo;Really,
      you know, there&rsquo;s no foundation for all this talk&mdash;all this
      nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? Then all the more need for me to drop her a friendly
      warning&mdash;guard her against shattered hopes and a broken heart and all
      that sort of thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tables were fairly turned, but Barbara, with quick woman&rsquo;s wit,
      saw that Roderick was really pained at the thought lest Gail Holden might
      learn of this jesting with her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; she said, reassuringly. &ldquo;We
      three will keep your secret, young man. We are all chums and brothers,
      aren&rsquo;t we now?&rdquo; And with one accord, laughing yet serious too,
      they all shook hands to seal the bond, and any breaches of confidence in
      the past were forgiven and forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a merry supper party, but it was now time to be starting for
      the ranch. As they rose from the table Roderick turned to Grant and said:
      &ldquo;You will have to excuse me, old boy, as I am taking the ladies
      home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taking the ladies home? Well, ain&rsquo;t I goin&rsquo; along?&rdquo;
      asked Grant, with a doleful look at Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No room in our sleigh,&rdquo; said Roderick coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick,&rdquo; said Grant, half sotto voce, &ldquo;you are cruel.&rdquo;
      But Roderick was unsympathetic and did not even smile. He turned away
      indifferently. Drawing Barbara aside, he told her in an undertone of the
      arrangements he had made with the livery stable for an extra sleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be alone with me,&rdquo; she said, with an amused
      smile. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be afraid? Broken heart, etc?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; he replied sturdily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or of Mr. Bragdon? He mightn&rsquo;t like it, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not afraid of him,&rdquo; laughed Roderick. &ldquo;And
      I guess he will trust me&mdash;and you,&rdquo; he added gently and with a
      chivalrous little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly the sleighs were brought round to the hotel. Grant was beside
      himself with delight when he discovered the extra rig for himself and
      Dorothy, and he laughingly shouted to Roderick: &ldquo;I say, old man, you&rsquo;re
      the best ever.&rdquo; Soon the merrymakers were tucked snugly beneath the
      lap robes, and were speeding over the glistening expanse of snow to the
      joyous tinkle of the silver bells.

      CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;WHITLEY ADAMS BLOWS IN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ODERICK WARFIELD&rsquo;S
      election to a seat on the board of directors of the Encampment Mine and
      Smelter Company had for him a series of most unexpected consequences. He
      had had no knowledge that Uncle Allen Miller and a number of his financial
      followers in Iowa were now large stockholders in the corporation. Nor had
      he been aware that Major Buell Hampton, after his journey to New York, had
      visited the Keokuk banker. The Major had learned from his brokers in Wall
      Street that Allen Miller was on the market for this particular stock and
      had already acquired a considerable holding. Hence his flying business
      visit to Keokuk, which had resulted in the combination of forces that had
      gained the control and ousted Grady, Carlisle, and their pawns on the old
      directorate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton had since been in continuous correspondence with the banker,
      but had never for a moment associated the names of Allen Miller and
      Roderick Warfield as having any possible connection by relationship or
      otherwise. The selection of the new board had been left entirely in Buell
      Hampton&rsquo;s hands after the banker had given his assent to the
      profit-sharing scheme. That assent had not been won without considerable
      argument. The plan upset all the banker&rsquo;s old theories about
      industrial enterprises. At the same time the shrewd old man of finance was
      reading the signs of the times, and had long since come to realize that a
      readjustment of the relations between capital and labor was inevitable. He
      was all the more inclined to make this experiment, in the first place
      because he was not going to be bothered with the working out of the
      practical details, and in the second place because the magnetic
      personality of Buell Hampton had at once inspired him with confidence both
      in his ability to do things and in his integrity. Therefore the shrewd old
      banker had fallen in with the Major&rsquo;s plans, and given him a free
      hand when entrusting him with the powers of attorney for himself and the
      other Iowan stockholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact there was another secret motive animating Allen Miller to
      this line of action. Unless he cooperated with Buell Hampton, the control
      would remain with W. B. Grady and his associates. And it was Grady whom
      the banker was after&mdash;Grady, the financial shark who had robbed his
      lifelong friend, General John Holden, of his underlying bonds in the
      original and now defunct smelter company, at the time when the
      amalgamation scheme had been devised to freeze out the first founders of
      the enterprise. General Holden had been the chief victim of this rapacious
      trick of financial jugglery, and Allen Miller was working secretly to undo
      the wrong. But the banker was animated not only by reasons of friendship.
      He had another incentive almost as strong. He wanted to satisfy his keen
      sense of personal pride toward Roderick Warfield. For the vital cause of
      quarrel between the old banker and the youth he loved yet had disowned was
      the unnamed girl he had thrust upon Roderick as a suitable bride because
      of her fortune. And this fortune had been proved to be illusory on the
      very day succeeding the rupture that had culminated in Roderick&rsquo;s
      fine display of scorn and anger, when he had flung himself out of the
      banker&rsquo;s room and started off for parts unknown to fight his own way
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the financial disaster which had overtaken General Holden that had
      opened Allen Miller&rsquo;s eyes to the truth that he had been utterly
      wrong in his attempted methods of managing a headstrong, and as the old
      guardian had thought at the time a wayward, youth like Roderick Warfield.
      He had bitterly regretted the harsh words that had dared the offender to
      play football with the world and, as he now realized, had by their
      sarcastic bitterness driven the high-mettled young man from his boyhood
      home. He had never doubted Roderick&rsquo;s prowess to make a way for
      himself by his own unaided efforts, and, despite the quarrel, had always
      felt sure of the lad&rsquo;s affection. So Roderick one day would come
      back, to find the latchstring hanging outside the door of his home, the
      promised place in the bank still awaiting him, and&mdash;the pride and
      dogged determination of the old man would not yield the point&mdash;the
      rich, attractive, and in every way highly eligible bride still available.
      The only flaw in the program was Gail Holden&rsquo;s fall from fortune,
      and to repair this had been the object of the banker&rsquo;s continuous
      and strenuous endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had grabbed at the chance of lending money on the Mine and Smelter
      Company bonds standing in the name of W. B. Grady, which bonds he
      considered were by moral right really the property of General Holden. But
      he had lent discreetly, postponing any big advance while he held the
      documents and nosed around for information that might give some valid
      reason to dispute their ownership. And in course of time he had made one
      surprising discovery. Obtaining from General Holden all correspondence
      with Grady, he had found one sentence in which the sponsor for the new
      amalgamation scheme had guaranteed the withdrawal of all underlying bonds
      in the old smelter company before the scheme would be put through. Yet
      this condition had not been complied with, for Allen Miller had, in the
      course of tracing every old bond, discovered that five were still in
      existence and had never been surrendered. They belonged to a widow away
      back in Pennsylvania who had gone to Europe and whose whereabouts at the
      time Grady apparently had not been able to ascertain. But the persistent
      old banker had followed the trail and through his agents in France had
      purchased this particular parcel of bonds at a high figure. They were few
      in number and insignificant in face value, but to Allen Miller they were
      priceless, for these underlying bonds put W. B. Grady in his power and
      could be made the means eventually of compelling restitution to General
      Holden of the fortune that had been filched from him. Grady would have to
      make good or face the criminal charge of a fraudulent transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton had been told nothing about this&mdash;it was sufficient for
      Allen Miller&rsquo;s immediate purpose to have the company control wrested
      without delay out of Grady&rsquo;s hands. This would render litigation
      easier, perhaps avoid it altogether&mdash;the better alternative, for the
      law&rsquo;s harassing delays and heart-sickening uncertainties are
      proverbial. So when Buell Hampton had come to Keokuk in the cause of
      humanity, to fight for the toilers at the smelter and in the big mine, he
      had been agreeably surprised to find in the old banker such a ready
      listener to his philanthropic arguments. The alliance had been struck,
      with the result that Buell Hampton had been able to swing the stockholders&rsquo;
      meeting exactly as he desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the very eve of that meeting the Major had kept his counsel and held
      his hand. The merest hint of the power he possessed might have given time
      for so astute a knave as Grady to devise some means more or less
      unscrupulous of repelling the attack. Therefore Buell Hampton had not
      dropped one word of what he intended to do until he had spoken to Roderick
      in his home on the night before the stockholders&rsquo; meeting. Little
      did either of them know at that time how vitally and directly Roderick was
      interested in the outcome of the Major&rsquo;s fight for the downtrodden
      poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the eventful meetings of stockholders and directors it had been
      Buell Hampton&rsquo;s first duty to send a full report of the proceedings
      to Allen Miller of Keokuk, whose power of attorney had enabled him to
      effect the coup deposing Grady and giving a share of the profits to the
      actual toilers at the furnaces and in the mine. In the course of this
      report the names of the new directors were set forth. Judge of the old
      banker&rsquo;s utter amazement when his eyes fell upon the name of&mdash;Roderick
      Warfield. Surprise quickly yielded to joy and delight. The news was
      telephoned to Aunt Lois. The old banker could not leave town at the moment&mdash;an
      issue of city bonds required his close attention. But that very night an
      envoy was dispatched to Wyoming in the person of his bright and trusted
      young clerk, Whitley Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the first of the series of surprises for Roderick Warfield, one
      afternoon a few days after the sleigh ride, was the sight of his old
      college chum tumbling out of a bob-sled which, in default of coaching
      facilities, had brought him over from the railroad at Rawlins. Whitley had
      stopped the sled in the main street along which, in the crisp sunshine
      that had followed the heavy snowfall, Roderick happened to be strolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old scout,&rdquo; cried the new arrival with all the ease of
      a veteran globe-trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in thunder did you drop from!&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick,
      clutching at his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Iowa&rsquo;s sun-kissed cornfields to Wyoming&rsquo;s
      snow-capped hills,&rdquo; laughed Whitley, humming the tune of the hymn he
      was parodying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has brought you here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of things. A letter for you, to begin with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Uncle Allen Miller.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m here, does he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole world knows you&rsquo;re here, dear boy,&rdquo; replied
      Whitley, pulling the latest issue of the <i>Encampment Herald</i> out of
      his pocket. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve become famous&mdash;a director of the
      great smelting corporation.&rdquo; And he flourished the journal aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent you that paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Buell Hampton, of course. At least he sent it to your uncle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out. You&rsquo;re kidding, Whitley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No kidding about me, old man. Those irresponsible days are now
      over.&rdquo; Whitley drew himself up with great dignity. &ldquo;If Buell
      Hampton hasn&rsquo;t told you that he came to Keokuk and made the
      acquaintance of Banker Allen Miller, well, that&rsquo;s his affair, not
      mine. Where shall we have dinner? I&rsquo;m as hungry as a grizzly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, Whitley. Do you mean to tell me Uncle Allen knows
      the Major?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. They&rsquo;ve been as thick as thieves&mdash;or rather I
      should say as close as twins&mdash;Oh, that reminds me. How are dear
      Barbara and Dorothy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up&mdash;stop your nonsense. What were you going to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just this, that ever since the Major paid us a visit at Keokuk,
      letters have been passing nearly every week between him and the banker. I&rsquo;ve
      seen all the correspondence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known nothing about this,&rdquo; said Roderick, in great
      perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doubtless you are not in the same confidential position as I
      occupy,&rdquo; replied Whitley airily. &ldquo;But of course now that you
      are a director of the company you&rsquo;ll come to know&mdash;or at least
      should know; that&rsquo;s part of your duties&mdash;that Allen Miller is a
      big stockholder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There flashed to Roderick&rsquo;s mind Buell Hampton&rsquo;s vague
      reference, on the night preceding the stockholders&rsquo; meeting, to some
      new friend, a professional man of finance, with whom he held joint control
      of the company&rsquo;s stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true friend of humanity,&rdquo; he murmured, recalling the Major&rsquo;s
      words. &ldquo;Great Scott, that&rsquo;s about the last identification tag
      I would have expected for Uncle Allen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old chap,&rdquo; interposed Whitley, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      mumble in conundrums. You take it from me that Buell Hampton and your
      uncle are financial pals&mdash;associates might be the more dignified
      word. That&rsquo;s no doubt why the Major nominated you for the board of
      directors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick paled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, if that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll resign tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve
      been standing on my own feet here. I owe nothing to Uncle Allen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, put all that touchy pride in your pocket, Roderick. By
      jingo, you&rsquo;re worse than Banker Miller himself. But I took the old
      gentleman down a few pegs the afternoon he learned that you were in
      Wyoming,&rdquo; Whitley rambled on, laughing. &ldquo;He declared that I
      must have known your hiding place all the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you answered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owned up at once, of course. Told him that others besides himself
      could be trusted with a confidence&mdash;that neither he nor anybody else
      could have bulldosed me into betraying a client. A client&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what I called you, old man. Oh, you can&rsquo;t give me business points
      nowadays. What do you think he said in reply?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ordered you out of the room, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life! Commended my sagacity, my trustworthiness; told
      me again that I was a born banker, one after his own heart. And to show
      that he meant what he said, he raised my salary five dollars a week, and
      handed me over fifty dollars extra spending money for this trip. What do
      you think of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t express a thought&mdash;I&rsquo;m too much surprised
      over the whole train of events.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose he knew I&rsquo;d have to buy a few boxes of candy
      for the beautiful Wyoming girls,&rdquo; Whitley went on. &ldquo;I had told
      him after my first trip here that they were regular stunners&mdash;that
      they had been buzzing about me like flies around a pot of honey. Oh, he
      laughed all right. I know how to manage the old fellow&mdash;was half
      afraid he&rsquo;d be coming along himself instead of sending me this time.
      But he bade me tell you he couldn&rsquo;t possibly get away from Keokuk
      just now. Which reminds me&mdash;here&rsquo;s your letter, old man; and
      one, too, from Aunt Lois. She saw me off at the train, and gave me a kiss
      to pass on to you.&rdquo; Whitley, a bunch of letters in his hand, made a
      movement as if to bestow upon Roderick the osculatory salute with which
      he had been entrusted. But Roderick, smiling in spite of himself, pushed
      him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You irrepressible donkey: Hand over my letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, the letters.&rdquo; Whitley began to sort the bunch of
      correspondence. &ldquo;This is for Buell Hampton. And this is for Ben
      Bragdon. I suppose he&rsquo;s in town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But he&rsquo;s pretty busy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be too busy to attend to me, I reckon. Then W. B. Grady&rdquo;&mdash;he
      was fingering a neatly folded, legal looking document &ldquo;I hope that
      Grady hasn&rsquo;t cleared out from Encampment yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve heard. In fact I saw him on the street this
      morning. You seem to have business with everyone in town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about hits it, old man. And General John Holden. Ah, yes, that
      reminds me,&rdquo; Whitley suspended his sorting of the letters, and
      looked up. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the college widow, old man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all off,&rdquo; he answered stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed that&rsquo;s just what would happen. Best so, by a long
      chalk, So Stella Rain is free again. Guess I&rsquo;ll stop off on my way
      home, and take a run to Galesburg. Nice girl, you know, Stella. No saying
      but I might make an impression now she is&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stella Rain is married,&rdquo; interrupted Roderick, speaking
      sharply and shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say? Too bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happily married, I tell you&mdash;to some rich fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, she threw you over, did she? Ho, ho, ho! But that&rsquo;s
      all right, old fellow. Saves all complications. And Gail, how&rsquo;s
      Gail? Oh, she&rsquo;s a pipit pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad, Whitley, you shut up. Come and have your dinner. But you
      haven&rsquo;t given me my letters yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I forgot Well this one is for General Holden. I&rsquo;ve got to
      see him at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confidential business, my friend. Ask no questions for I want to be
      spared the pain of refusing you the slightest information. Great guns,
      Rod, we financial men, you know, hold more secrets than a father
      confessor. We&rsquo;ve got to keep our mouths shut all the time, even to
      our best friends. This is my letter of credit to your local bank&mdash;no
      limit, mind you, on my sight drafts on Keokuk. Ah, yes, here are your
      letters&mdash;one from Aunt Lois, the other from your old guardian. Hope
      he has put a fat check inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need his checks&mdash;if there&rsquo;s any check
      here, you can take it back.&rdquo; And Roderick ripped open the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no offending slip of colored paper enclosed, and he thrust
      both the letters unread into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll dine,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment, please.&rdquo; And Whitley turned to the driver of the
      bob-sled waiting in the middle of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and get your dinner, my man,&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Then
      hitch fresh horses in that sled, and come to my hotel, the Bonhomme; that&rsquo;s
      the best place in town, if I remember right, Roderick,&rdquo; he said with
      a glance at his friend. Then he continued to the driver: &ldquo;Charge
      everything to me, and don&rsquo;t be longer than a couple of hours. Now
      come along, Roderick. You dine with me&mdash;oh, I have an ample expense
      fund. But I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ll have to leave you immediately after
      dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was overwhelmed by all this grandiloquence. He hardly dared to
      take his old chum&rsquo;s arm as they walked along the street. But at last
      he stopped, burst out laughing, and slapped the man of affairs squarely
      between the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitley, old chap, you&rsquo;re a wonder. You play the part to
      perfection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play the part?&rdquo; protested Whitley, with a fine assumption of
      dignity. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> the part&mdash;the real thing. I&rsquo;m your
      rich old uncle&rsquo;s right hand man, and don&rsquo;t you forget it.
      Would a little ready cash now be a convenience?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Whitley&rsquo;s arm went round his comrade&rsquo;s neck, and with a
      simultaneous whoop of laughter they passed into the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the next twenty-four hours Roderick saw very little of his
      college chum. And during the same period the said college chum
      accomplished some very remarkable things. Immediately after dinner the
      bob-sled sped out to Conchshell ranch, and General Holden signed the legal
      papers that attached, as a measure of precaution, the bonds standing in
      the name of W. B. Grady and now in the custody of the bank at Keokuk as
      security for a loan. And for half the night Attorney Ben Bragdon and
      Whitley Adams were closeted with W. B. Grady in a private parlor of the
      hotel, and the fight was fought out for legal possession of the
      fraudulently acquired bonds&mdash;a fight that put the issue squarely up
      to Grady whether he would accept Banker Allen Miller&rsquo;s terms of
      surrender or face a criminal charge. It was in the grey of the breaking
      dawn that the vanquished Grady crept out of the hotel, wiping the beads of
      cold sweat from his brow, while Whitley was quietly folding up the
      properly signed transfers that gave back to General Holden bonds of equal
      value to those of which he had been robbed by false pretences and promises
      never fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Whitley was again at the Conchshell ranch, and breakfasted
      with the General and his daughter. It was the latter who bound him to
      secrecy&mdash;to the solemn promise that neither he nor Mr. Bragdon should
      divulge to anyone the story of this restored family fortune. Gail declared
      that she was going to make good with her dairy cattle venture, that
      neither she nor her father wanted to return to the old life of fashion and
      society at Quincy, that they had no wish to appear as rich folks. Whitley
      listened to all the arguments, understood, and promised. And that the
      transfer of the bonds should not be connected with General Holden&rsquo;s
      name it was agreed that for the present they should pass to Banker Allen
      Miller as family trustee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitley&rsquo;s chest had expanded fully two inches when he drove away,
      the trusted emissary for the carrying into effect of these decrees. He had
      had a few minutes alone with Gail and, introducing the name of Roderick
      Warfield in a casual way, had assured her that he, like everyone else,
      would know nothing about these strictly family affairs. She had blushed a
      little, reiterated her thanks, and at parting had, he could have sworn,
      given him an extra friendly pressure of her dainty little fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitley drove straight to Ben Bragdon&rsquo;s office, and took the
      precaution of adding to the professional seal of secrecy a direct
      expression from the General of his wishes in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the afternoon the young banker from Keokuk personally delivered the
      letter from Allen Miller addressed to Major Buell Hampton. Whitley had
      insisted upon Roderick accompanying him. The relationship between Roderick
      and Banker Miller was now revealed. The Major received the news without
      much surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the loom of life,&rdquo; he said, with great solemnity, &ldquo;the
      shuttle of destiny weaves the threads of individual lives into a pattern
      which is only disclosed as time goes on. Thus are the destinies of men
      interwoven without their knowing either the how or the why. Roderick, my
      dear fellow, from this day on we are simply more closely bound to each
      other than ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was spent at the Shields ranch. Whitley congratulated Barbara
      on her engagement to Ben Bragdon, and then took Dorothy&rsquo;s breath
      away by congratulating her and the absent Grant Jones as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy blushed furiously, and disowned the soft impeachment; to which
      Whitley replied that unless her sweetheart got busy promptly and toed the
      line, he himself was coming back to Encampment to cut out so tardy a
      wooer. &ldquo;Tell Grant Jones from me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
      taking chances to leave the tempting peach upon the tree.&rdquo; She
      slapped his hand playfully for his audacity, and Roderick hurried the
      flippant financier out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, in the bright moonlight, Whitley departed for Rawlins to
      catch his train. Nothing could persuade him to prolong his visit&mdash;Banker
      Miller would be hopping around like a cat on hot bricks, the bank going to
      wreck and ruin if he did not hurry back, the girls of Keokuk growing quite
      jealous of the beauties of Wyoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a whiff of sweet perfume the joyous youth was gone.

      CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;RODERICK&rsquo;S DISCOVERY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OTWITHSTANDING
      their change in fortunes,
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick and Grant still made the editor&rsquo;s shack their home&mdash;the
      old place endeared to them by many fond associations. A few days after
      Whitley Adams&rsquo; visit they were seated at the breakfast table, and
      Grant had proposed that they should go deer hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent weather,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;as the snow is just
      deep enough up in the mountains to drive the deer down. Finest sport in
      the world. Nothing like going after big game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You almost persuade me,&rdquo; said Roderick, setting down his
      coffee and looking at Grant with increased interest. &ldquo;All the same I
      hate to leave the smelter plant even for a day or two. You see I&rsquo;m
      just beginning to get a hang of the business, and I&rsquo;ve quite made up
      my mind to master it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let it rip. You&rsquo;re not tied down to the works, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;you don&rsquo;t imagine I think myself
      qualified as yet to be tied down. &lsquo;But what about guns?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;I have a.32 Winchester, one
      that has got a record too, by gunnies, as Jim Rankin would say. Its record
      is great.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How big a record?&rdquo; inquired Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven deer,&rdquo; answered Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All your own killing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no. To be downright truthful since you force me to
      particularize, I&rsquo;ll admit I never killed but one deer with it. But
      that does not interfere with the gun&rsquo;s record.&rdquo; And then he
      continued: &ldquo;I have no doubt Major Hampton will be delighted to loan
      you his gun. He has a .30 calibre Government Springfield and in his hands
      it has accounted for many a buck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast they called on Major Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Major as he opened the
      door and bade them welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going deer hunting,&rdquo; said Grant, quite
      enthusiastically. &ldquo;I have a gun, but
      this-would-be-slayer-of-big-game, Roderick, is gunless and when we return
      he may be deerless. Was just wondering, Major, if you would care to loan
      your famous deer killer to him. Guess its long record,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;would fill a book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; replied the Major in an absent-minded way;
      and then presently he went on: &ldquo;Do not interpret my hesitation as
      unwillingness to accommodate you. It is well you came just when you did,
      for within half an hour I myself will be starting for the mountains and my
      mind was pre-occupied with my own little preparations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you come with us, Major?&rdquo; asked Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t be depriving you of your gun?&rdquo; enquired
      Roderick simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answer &lsquo;no&rsquo; to both questions,&rdquo; was the smiling
      response. &ldquo;I am going out on one of my lonesome excursions&mdash;to
      commune with Nature face to face for a brief spell. And when I go I need
      no rifle&mdash;even the very deer there are my trustful friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning he took down his rifle from its accustomed place and brought
      it over to Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This old Springfield has served me well,&rdquo; he said, smiling in
      his own magnificent way. &ldquo;It was my friend in dark days of need. In
      my lifetime, gentlemen, I have never spilled the blood of any living thing
      wantonly, and I do not believe man is justified in taking the life of even
      a worm on the pathway, a rabbit in the hills, cattle or sheep in the
      fields, or a deer in the wilds unless it is for food and to sustain life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly looking at Grant the Major said: &ldquo;I understand W. R.
      Grady is up in the hills?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I have heard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing? Looking for a mine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. They say he is at the Thomas Boarding House most of the
      time up at Battle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; interrupted Roderick, &ldquo;that he is not very
      happy since the new order of things&mdash;your new plan, Major&mdash;put
      him out of business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is getting in touch again with his old heeler, Bud
      Bledsoe,&rdquo; suggested Grant. &ldquo;That outlaw gang has been lying
      low for quite a while, but I&rsquo;m expecting to hear about some new bit
      of deviltry any day. Am in need of a corking good newspaper story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you are bent on hunting big game,&rdquo; laughed the
      Major, &ldquo;these miscreants might provide you with all the exciting
      sport you are wanting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a brace of good fat bucks will be good enough for us. Where&rsquo;s
      the likeliest place to start from, Major? You&rsquo;re the local authority
      on these matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where Spirit River Falls are?&rdquo; asked Buell Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of them but have never been there,&rdquo; replied
      Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I&rsquo;ve seen them from above,&rdquo; observed
      Roderick, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know the way to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know where Gid Sutton&rsquo;s half-way house is located?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;I was there less than a
      month ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Spirit River Falls are located about six or seven miles south
      and east of the half-way house. I advise that one of you go up the South
      Fork of the Encampment River and the other keep to the right and go over
      the hills past Conchshell ranch into a park plateau to the south; then
      have your meeting place this evening in an old log structure that you will
      find about three-fourths of a mile directly through the timber southeast
      from the falls. If you are wise, you will load up two or three burros,
      send them with a trusty, and have him make camp for you in this old
      deserted hut. You will find a cup of coffee, a rasher of bacon and a few
      sandwiches very appetizing by the time you have tramped all day in your
      deer-hunting quest And the country all around is full of deer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men thanked him warmly for his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In point of fact,&rdquo; continued Buell Hampton, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      be up in the same region myself. But I&rsquo;m travelling light and will
      have the start of you. Moreover, we can very easily lose each other in
      that rugged country of rocks and timber. But don&rsquo;t mistake me for a
      buck, Roderick, if you catch sight of my old sombrero among the brushwood;&rdquo;
      saying which he reached for the broad-brimmed slouch hat hanging against
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take mighty good care,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;But
      I hope we&rsquo;ll run up against you, Major, all the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t find me,&rdquo; answered Buell Hampton, with a
      quiet smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hidden from all the world. Follow the
      deer, young men, and the best of luck to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two comrades started away in high feather, anticipating great results
      from the tip given them by the veteran hunter. Going straight to the
      livery bam, they rigged out three burros, and sent with them one of the
      stablemen who, besides being a fairly good cook, happened to be familiar
      with the trail to Spirit River Falls, and also knew the location of the
      &ldquo;hunter&rsquo;s hut&rdquo; as they found the old log structure
      indicated by Buell Hampton was locally named.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arrangements concluded, Roderick and Grant started for the hills.
      Some half a mile from Encampment they separated&mdash;Jones going along
      the east bank of the South Fork of the Encampment River and Roderick
      following the North Fork until he came to Conchshell canyon. The day was
      an ideal one for a deer hunt. There was not a breath of wind. The sky was
      overcast in a threatening manner as if it were full of snow that was
      liable to flutter down at the slightest provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick reached the plateau that constituted the Conchshell ranch he
      concluded to bear to the left and as he said to himself &ldquo;Keep away
      from temptation.&rdquo; He was out hunting wild deer that day and he must
      not permit himself to make calls on a sweet-throated songster like Gail.
      On through the open fields and over the fences and into a thick growth of
      pines and firs, where he plodded his way through snow that crunched and
      cried loudly under his feet Indeed the stillness of everything excepting
      his own walking began to grate on his nerves and he said to himself that
      surely a whitetailed deer with ordinary alertness could hear him walking
      even if it were half a mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he trudged along mile after mile he was very watchful for game or
      tracks, but nothing stirred, no trace of deer was discernible in any
      direction. He was following the rim of a hill surmounting some boxlike
      canyons that led away abruptly to the left, while a smooth field or park
      reached far to the right where the hills were well covered with timber.
      Here and there an opening of several acres in extent occurred without bush
      or shrub.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon and he was becoming a
      bit leg-weary. Brushing the snow away from a huge boulder he seated
      himself for a short rest. Scarcely had he done so than he noticed that
      occasional flakes of snow were falling. &ldquo;More snow,&rdquo; he
      muttered to himself, &ldquo;and I am a good ways from a cup of coffee if I
      am any judge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After he was rested he got up and again moved on. Just then, as he looked
      down into a box canyon, he saw three deer&mdash;a doe and two half-grown
      fawns. Quickly bringing his gun to his shoulder his first impulse was to
      fire. But he realized that it would be foolish for the animals were at
      least five hundred yards away and far below the elevation where he was
      standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I will leave the rim of this
      mountain and get down into the canyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily retreated, and took a circuitous route intending to head off
      the deer. In due time he approached the brow of the precipitous bluff and
      after walking back and forth finally found a place where he believed he
      could work his way down into the canyon. It was a dangerous undertaking&mdash;far
      more so than Roderick knew&mdash;and might have proved his undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perhaps half way down the side of the cliff, working his way back
      and forth, when suddenly some loose stones slipped from under his feet and
      away he went, sliding in a sitting position down the side of the mountain.
      He had sufficient presence of mind to hold his gun well away from him to
      prevent any possible accident from an accidental discharge. The cushioning
      of the snow under him somewhat slowed his descent, yet he could not stop.
      Down and down he went, meeting with no obstruction that might have given
      him a momentary foothold. Presently he saw, to his great relief of mind,
      that he was headed for a small fir tree that had rooted itself on a ledge
      near the bottom of the canyon. A moment later his feet came thump against
      its branches, and while the jar and shock of suddenly arrested motion were
      very considerable yet they were not enough to be attended with any serious
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat dazed, he remained seated for a few moments. But soon he found
      his footing, and pulling himself together, brushed away the snow from his
      apparel and made sure that his gun was all right. After a glance around he
      picked his way down some distance farther into the canyon, and then
      turning to the right along a little ledge started in the direction where
      he expected to sight the deer higher up the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stopped. There were the deer tracks right before him going
      down the gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George,&rdquo; he muttered aloud, &ldquo;I did not get far
      enough down. However, I will follow the tracks.&rdquo; And forthwith he
      started on the trail, cautiously but highly expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The direction was westerly, but he had not gone far until the canyon made
      an elbow turn to the south and then a little farther on to the east.
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Roderick to himself, &ldquo;what sort of a
      maze I am getting into. This canyon is more crooked than an old-fashioned
      worm fence or a Wyoming political boss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The box canyon continued to grow deeper and the rocky cliffs higher,
      zig-zagging first one way and then another until Roderick gave up all
      pretense of even guessing at the direction he was travelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange I have never heard of this narrow box-canyon before,&rdquo;
      he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking briskly along for about an hour, keeping the tracks of the
      retreating deer in view, he suddenly came to an opening. A little valley
      was spread out before him, and to his amazement there were at least a
      hundred deer herded together in the park-like enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick rubbed his eyes and looked up at the high and abrupt precipices
      that surrounded this open valley on every side. It seemed to him that the
      walls rose sheer and almost perpendicular several hundred feet to the
      rocky rim above. He followed on down, filled with wonderment, and
      presently was further astonished by finding several great bubbling
      springs. Each basin was fully a hundred feet across, and the agitated
      waters evidently defied freezing, for they fairly boiled in their
      activity, overflowing and coming together to form quite a big tumbling
      mountain stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stealthily following on and keeping the great herd in view he mentally
      speculated on the surprise he would give Grant Jones when he came to
      display the proofs of his prowess as a hunter of the hills. Surely with
      his belt full of cartridges and the large number of deer in sight,
      although as yet too far away to risk a shot, he could add several antlered
      heads to Grant&rsquo;s collection. The stream grew larger. There were a
      number of other springs feeding their surplus waters into brooks which
      eventually all joined the main stream, and he mentally resolved that the
      next time Gail and he went trout-fishing they would visit this identical
      spot. He laughed aloud and asked the question: &ldquo;Will she be mine so
      that we may come together for a whole week into this beautiful dell?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The farther he advanced the less snow he found in the strange, rock-fenced
      valley. The grasses had grown luxuriantly in the summer season, and the
      deer were browsing in seeming indifference to his presence yet moving on
      away from him all the time. He began wondering if all this were a mirage
      or a reality. He looked a second time at the slowly receding herd and
      again he laughed aloud. &ldquo;Such foolishness,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;It is an absolute reality, and right here I will make my name and
      fame as a hunter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly, for just across the stream, standing among the
      boulders and pebbles of an old channel, were four deer, not two hundred
      feet away. They were looking at him in mild-eyed wonder, one of them a
      noble, splendidly antlered buck. Lifting the Major&rsquo;s Springfield to
      his shoulder Roderick sighted along the barrel and fired. Three of the
      deer ran away. But the buck jumped high into the air, attempted to climb
      the opposite bank, failed and fell backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly crossing over the stream and slipping in his excitement off the
      stones into knee-deep water, he came quickly up to the wounded deer.
      Instantly the animal bounded to his feet, but fell again. Roderick fired a
      second shot which reached a vital spot. The magnificent denizen of the
      hills had been vanquished in the uneven contest with man&rsquo;s superior
      knowledge and deadly skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novice in huntsman&rsquo;s craft had received all sorts of book
      instructions and verbal explanations from Grant Jones. So he at once drew
      his hunting knife, thrust it into the jugular vein of the dying deer, and
      bled him copiously. Only the hunter knows the exultant feelings of mingled
      joy and excitement that possessed Roderick at that moment. His first deer!
      Resting the gun against a small cottonwood tree that grew on a raised bank
      between the old channel and the flowing waters, he walked to the stream,
      washed the crimson from his knife, and returned the weapon to its sheath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked around to get his bearings. He knew he had come with the
      waters from what seemed to be a westerly direction. The stream was
      evidently flowing toward the east. As he walked along in the old channel
      over the sandbar he kicked the rocks and pebbles indifferently, and then
      stopped suddenly, gasped and looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every side the mountains rose precipitately fully six or seven hundred
      feet. There was no visible outlet for the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; he exclaimed with bated breath, &ldquo;that
      I am in the lost canyon? And this,&rdquo; he said, stooping down and
      picking up a nugget of almost pure gold&mdash;&ldquo;is this the sandbar
      on which my father and Uncle Allen Miller found their treasure yeans and
      years ago? Marvelous! Marvelous! Marvelous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment the slain deer was forgotten. His achievement as a hunter
      of big game no longer thrilled him. He was overwhelmed by a mightier surge
      of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said finally in a low voice of conviction, &ldquo;this
      at last is the lost find!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he sank down on the gold-strewn pebbly sandbar, limp and helpless,
      completely overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later he had recovered his composure. He stood erect He gazed
      down the valley. The startled herd of deer had vanished into the brushwood
      and low timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there, slowly ascending along the river bed, was the figure of Buell
      Hampton. Roderick stood stockstill, lost in amazement, waiting.

      CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;STAKING THE CLAIMS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>O IT is you who
      have found my Hidden Valley,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton as he drew near.
      His voice had a regretful ring, but as he grasped Roderick&rsquo;s hand he
      added cordially: &ldquo;I thank God it is you, Roderick. When I heard the
      rifle shots I was afraid it might be Bud Bledsoe or some of his gang.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hidden valley, Major?&rdquo; murmured Roderick,
      interrogatively and with emphasis on the first word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my son&mdash;the valley from which I took the carload of rich
      ore we sold in Denver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great guns, Major. I too have discovered gold&mdash;placer gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your feet. Look.&rdquo; And Roderick stooped and picked up a
      fine smooth-worn nugget as big as a pigeon&rsquo;s egg. &ldquo;Look, look,
      look,&rdquo; continued Roderick. &ldquo;It is all around us on this
      sandbar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not happen on this spot,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton. &ldquo;The
      fact is I hardly explored the valley at all. I had all the gold I wanted
      or could ever want in my own find.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where is that find?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower down the stream&mdash;a dyke of porphyry and white quartz.
      But you already know the kind of ore Jim Rankin, Tom Sun, and Boney
      Earnest helped me to get out of the valley. It is quite different from
      your gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major stooped, and collected a handful of good-sized nuggets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to find this place, Roderick?&rdquo; he asked,
      gazing up at the sheer cliffs around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been searching for it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;since ever
      I came to Wyoming. Oh, Major, it is a strange story. I hardly know where
      to begin. But wait. Sit down on that boulder. I have my father&rsquo;s
      letter with me. You can read it and will then understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From an inner pocket Roderick produced the map and letter which had never
      left his possession, night or day, since his Uncle Allen had handed him
      the sealed packet in the bank manager&rsquo;s room at Keokuk. Without a
      word Buell Hampton took the seat indicated, and after a preliminary glance
      at the map proceeded to read the long epistle left by the old miner, John
      Warfield, as a dying legacy to his son. Roderick sitting on his heels
      watched in silence while the other read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was a sensible man,&rdquo; remarked Buell Hampton, as
      at last he refolded the paper. &ldquo;I like the spirit in which he wrote&mdash;the
      fervent expression of his hope that this wealth will prove a blessing to
      you instead of a disquieting evil. Yes, you have undoubtedly found your
      father&rsquo;s lost mine. But, Roderick, why did you not tell me of this
      before? I would have gladly helped you to a quicker discovery. This map
      here I would have recognized at a glance as the map of my happy retreat,
      my Hidden Valley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Major, I may seem to have been a bit reticent&mdash;or
      independent, may I call it? But you will remember that it was early in our
      intimacy when you showed me and the others those rich ore specimens in
      your home. And you yourself were reticent&mdash;bound us to secrecy, yet
      gave us no-single clue as to the whereabouts of your wonderful discovery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wanted to protect this place from intrusion&mdash;I
      indulged in the dream that the treasure of the valley might be made to
      fall only into worthy hands, which dream could never be realized unless I
      guarded my secret from one and all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sentiment I quite understand. But don&rsquo;t you see, Major,
      it was this very reticence on your part that made me reticent&mdash;that
      virtually sealed my lips? I have often thought of showing you my father&rsquo;s
      letter, of telling the full reasons that brought me to Wyoming. But to
      have done so after you had shown us that ore would have been simply to
      press you for further information&mdash;to have asked you to divulge the
      location of your mine which you had resolved to keep secret so that I
      might possibly be assisted in the quest for my father&rsquo;s lost claim.
      I couldn&rsquo;t do that I am sure you will now understand my feelings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine feelings, Roderick,&rdquo; exclaimed the Major, extending his
      hand. &ldquo;Feelings after my own heart I understand them, and can only
      compliment you on your sturdy independence. But how did you get here?&rdquo;
      And again he glanced up the precipitous mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think I might almost say I tumbled down into the canyon,&rdquo;
      laughed Roderick. &ldquo;I slipped and tobogganed down a steep slope. Then
      I followed the tracks of four deer I was after, and found myself here. By
      the way, have you looked at my splendid buck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton rose, and as if by force of habit drew his hunting knife and
      proceeded to dress and gambrel the deer. Roderick watched the skilled
      hands at work. Before many minutes the carcass was hanging on the peg of a
      broken limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, a fine buck,&rdquo; remarked the Major, stepping back
      admiringly. &ldquo;Your first, I believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My very first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not often that a man kills his first deer and discovers a gold mine
      on the same day, eh?&rdquo; laughed Buell Hampton. &ldquo;But where is
      Grant Jones?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him since morning. We followed your
      directions, and took opposite sides of the river.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will meet you tonight at the old log hut?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our arrangement. But how are we to get out of this
      box-canyon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can show you an easier way out than the toboggan slide by which
      you came in,&rdquo; replied the Major, smiling. &ldquo;At the same time I
      think I should prefer to follow your tracks, so that in the future I may
      know this second means of access. I am afraid the secret of this little
      sequestered valley can be no longer kept from the world. I presume you are
      going to stake out a claim and record it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; laughed Roderick. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sentiment
      about sequestered valleys or happy retreats in my make-up. Great Scott,
      there&rsquo;s a cool million dollars of gold lying around right here. I&rsquo;m
      going to take no chances of the next man finding the spot. Isn&rsquo;t
      that common sense, Major?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; replied Buell Hampton, &ldquo;it is common sense
      in your case. And you are obviously following your father&rsquo;s bidding
      in making the fullest and the best use of the wealth he tried so long in
      vain to rediscover. Are you familiar with the regulations as to staking
      out a claim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve posted myself on all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, choose your ground, and I&rsquo;ll whittle your stakes.&rdquo;
      He rose and again unsheathed his hunting knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; cried Roderick, &ldquo;along this old channel there&rsquo;s
      at least three men&rsquo;s ground. We&rsquo;ll stake for you and for me
      and for Grant Jones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Grant Jones must have been on his claim before he can file on
      it. That&rsquo;s the law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring him down tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, go ahead,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I think it is right
      and proper to secure all the ground we can. I believe it will be all for
      the best that it should be in our hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Within an hour stakes had been placed at the corners of the three placer
      claims, and the proper location notices, written on leaves torn from Buell
      Hampton&rsquo;s note book, affixed to a stake in the centre of each claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that this complies with all legal requirements,&rdquo;
      remarked the Major, as they surveyed their workmanship. &ldquo;Now,
      Roderick, tit for tat. You will come down the valley with me, and we shall
      secure, as lode claims, the porphyry dyke from which I have cut out merely
      the rich outcrop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hour&rsquo;s labor saw the second task completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were back at Roderick&rsquo;s sandbar, and had filled their pockets
      with nuggets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the ascent,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton. &ldquo;Tomorrow
      morning we shall return, and breakfast here on your venison. Hurry up now;
      the evening shadows are already falling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail left by Roderick and the four deer through the canyon and along
      the <i>zigzag</i> gash in the mountains above the bubbling springs was
      clearly traceable in the snow. When the narrow ledge by which Roderick had
      descended into the gorge was reached the Major took the precaution of
      blazing an occasional tree trunk for future direction. Progress was easy
      until they reached the abrupt declivity down which the hunter had slipped.
      A little farther along the deer appeared to have descended the steep
      incline by a series of leaps. In the gathering dusk it was impossible to
      proceed farther; steps would have to be cut or a careful search made for
      some way around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go back,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton. &ldquo;Now I will show
      you my means of access to the canyon&mdash;one of the most wonderful rock
      galleries in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Retracing their footsteps they hastened along at the best speed possible,
      and soon reached the tunnel into which the river disappeared. Producing
      his electric torch, the Major prepared to lead the way. He lingered for
      just a moment to gaze back into the canyon which was now enveloped in the
      violet haze of eventide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not lovely?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Alas, that such a
      place of perfect peace and beauty should come to be deserted and
      despoiled!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was fingering the slugs of gold in his pocket. He followed the
      direction of the Major&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is all very beautiful,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But
      scenery is scenery, Major, and gold is gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little torch flashed like an evening star as they disappeared into the
      grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton and Roderick had gazed up the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had failed to observe two human forms crouched among the
      brushwood not fifty yards away&mdash;the forms of Bud Bledsoe and Grady,
      who had that morning tracked the Major from his home to the falls, under
      the cataract, through the rock gallery, right into the hidden canyon,
      intent on discovering the secret whence the carload of rich ore had come,
      bent on revenge for Grady&rsquo;s undoing with the smelting company when
      the proper moment should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Buell Hampton, Roderick Warfield, and Grant Jones supped
      frugally at the hunter&rsquo;s hut on ham sandwiches and coffee. Down in
      Hidden Valley on the gold-strewn sandbar W. B. Grady and his henchman
      feasted royally on venison steaks cut from the fat buck Roderick&rsquo;s
      gun had provided. They had already torn down the location notices and
      substituted their own. And far into the night by the light of their camp
      fire the claim-jumpers searched for the nuggets among the pebbles and
      gathered them into a little heap, stopping only from their frenzied quest
      to take an occasional gulp of whiskey from the big flask without which Bud
      Bledsoe never stirred. When daylight broke, exhausted, half-drunk, both
      were fast asleep beside the pile of stolen gold.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;THE SNOW SLIDE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>URING the night a
      few flakes of snow had fallen&mdash;just the flurry of a storm that had
      come and tired and paused to rest awhile. The morning broke grey and
      sombre and intensely still; the mantle of white that covered the ground
      and clung to bushes and tree branches seemed to muffle every sound; the
      atmosphere was clear, but filled with brooding expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three friends at the hunter&rsquo;s hut were early astir. Roderick,
      despite the fact that fortune had at last smiled and crowned with success
      the prolonged quest for his father&rsquo;s lost mine, was strangely
      oppressed. Buell Hampton, too, was grave and inclined to silence. But
      Grant Jones was gay and happy, singing blithely during the preparations
      for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the previous night he had received the story of the find with exultant
      delight. With such a rich mining claim all the ambitions of his life were
      about to be realized. He would buy out his financial partners in the <i>Dillon
      Doublejack</i> and publish it as a daily newspaper&mdash;hang the expense,
      the country would grow and with it the circulation, and he would be in
      possession of the field against all-comers. Then again he would acquire
      the <i>Encampment Herald</i> although keeping on the brilliant Earle
      Clemens as editor; also start another paper at Rawlins, and in a little
      time run a whole string of journals, like some of the big newspaper men
      whose names were known throughout the nation. Listening to these glowing
      plans as they drank their morning coffee around the campfire, Roderick and
      the Major could not but admire the boyish gaiety of this sanguine spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to propose to Dorothy tomorrow,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Grant by way of grand finale to his program of great expectations, &ldquo;and
      the Reverend Stephen Grannon will marry us before the week is out We&rsquo;ll
      spend our honeymoon in Chicago so that I can buy some new printing presses
      and things. Then we&rsquo;ll be back in time to bring out a grand
      mid-winter number that will make all Wyoming sit up and take notice. By
      gad, boys, it&rsquo;s great to be a newspaper editor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better to be a newspaper proprietor,&rdquo; laughed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or both combined,&rdquo; suggested the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you&rsquo;ve hit it,&rdquo; cried Grant. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
      just the luck that has come my way at last&mdash;thanks to you, Roderick,
      old scout, and to you, Major, as well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Buell Hampton. &ldquo;With your happy
      disposition and great capacity for work, success was bound to be yours, my
      dear fellow. The manner of its coming is a mere detail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way a good friend cloaks good deeds,&rdquo;
      replied Grant. &ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ll let it go at that. Pass the
      frying pan please; this bacon&rsquo;s just fine.&rdquo; Plans for the day
      were carefully discussed. The man in charge of the burros had not been
      taken into their confidence; as a member of the expedition he would be
      properly looked after later on, but meanwhile strict secrecy was the only
      wise policy until the location papers had been properly filed at the
      county seat, Rawlins. This filing would undoubtedly be the signal for a
      rush of all the miners and prospectors within a hundred miles of the
      little treasure valley among the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there will be a regular stampede,&rdquo; remarked the Major&mdash;&ldquo;provided
      the snow holds off,&rdquo; he added with a glance at the grey canopy of
      cloud overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are in for another storm,&rdquo; said Grant, gazing
      around. &ldquo;If so, the whole country will be sealed up until the
      spring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is not the worst thing that might happen,&rdquo; commented
      Buell Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would certainly give us ample time to make all our arrangements for
      the future,&rdquo; concurred Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that they would take with them that morning the sacks in
      which the provisions had been brought up, and bring back as much gold as
      they could carry. For a moment Grant and Roderick discussed the
      advisability of leaving their guns behind. But there were outlaws among
      the mountains, and it was deemed prudent to carry the weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      All preparations were now completed, and a start was made, the stableman
      being left in charge of the camp with instructions to have a good fire of
      embers ready for the brisket of venison they would return with about the
      noontide hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton led the way at a swinging gait,
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick followed, then came Grant Jones singing lustily:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;As I was coming down the road,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tired team and a heavy load,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I cracked my whip and the leader sprang
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the off horse stepped on the wagon tongue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A little way down the hill Grant called a halt He had discovered on the
      light dusting of overnight snow the tracks of a big bear, and for the
      moment everything else was forgotten. Bear-hunting to him was of more
      immediate interest than gold-hunting, and but for the restraining hand of
      Buell Hampton the ardent young sportsman would have started on the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop a while,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Just look at
      those pads. A great big cinnamon bear&mdash;a regular whale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Major decisively, again glancing at the
      sky. &ldquo;We must press on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a hug all right,&rdquo; laughed Roderick, &ldquo;but
      not from a cinnamon bear in a snowdrift.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, but I&rsquo;m sorry I left my dogs at Dillon,&rdquo; remarked
      Grant regretfully. &ldquo;The last thing I said to Scotty Meisch was to
      look after the dogs even if the printing press burned. There&rsquo;s no
      friend like a good dog, Major.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a doubtful compliment,&rdquo; replied Buell Hampton with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present company always excepted,&rdquo; laughed the editor
      adroitly. &ldquo;Well, well; we must let Mr. Bruin go this time. Lead on,
      Macduff, lead on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And again as he fell into Indian file he sang his song.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lilt and the words of that song, the picture of the stalwart figure in
      the pride of young manhood carolling gaily while marching along through
      the brushwood and down the timbered hillside, were des-tined never to fade
      from the memory of Roderick Warfield. With a sob in his heart he would
      recall the scene many and many a time in the days to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile at the camp fire in Hidden Valley, Grady and Bud Bledsoe were
      also afoot. They had awaked from their half drunken slumber, chilled to
      the very marrow of their bones. Even the sight of the heap of nuggets
      could not at first restore warmth to their hearts. There was no whiskey
      left in the flask&mdash;not a drain. Their teeth chattering, they piled
      fresh brush on the camp fire, and then a half-rotted tree stump that soon
      burst into flame. Then when warmth at last crept through their frames,
      they too made their plans for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton and Roderick Warfield might come back. Perhaps they had
      camped all night in the mountain cave. In any case it would be safer to
      leave the canyon by the other way&mdash;by the trail along which Roderick
      must have entered and which was quite clearly defined in the snow as it
      led up the gorge. Yes; they would clear out in that direction, and Bud
      Bledsoe, who knew every track among the mountains, further proposed that
      they would then cross the range and take the west road to Rawlins. With a
      price on his head he himself could not enter the town&mdash;although a
      little later some of the new-found gold would square all that, for the
      present he must lie low. But he would guide Grady on the way, and the
      latter would get into Rawlins first and file the location papers without
      anyone at Encampment knowing that he had made the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dope,&rdquo; cried Bud Bledsoe, as he jumped to
      his feet and began stuffing his pockets to their fullest capacity with the
      big and little slugs of gold. Grady followed his example. Then both men
      took up their guns, Bledsoe also the light but strong hair lariat which
      was his constant companion whether he was on horse or foot, and began
      making their way up the canyon, following the well-trodden path through
      the snow along which Buell Hampton and Roderick had retraced their
      footsteps the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a couple of hours later when the Major, Grant Jones, and Roderick
      emerged from the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major. &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo;
      And with extended arm he pointed to the ascending smoke of the camp fire
      higher up the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the caution of deerstalkers they ascended by the stream. They found
      that the camp fire was abandoned. The half-gnawed bones, the empty whiskey
      flask, the remnant heap of nuggets, the hollows on the sand where the two
      men had slept&mdash;all helped to tell the tale. The names on the
      substituted location papers completed the story&mdash;W. B. Grady&rsquo;s
      name and those of some dummies to hold the ground, illegally but to hold
      it all the same. Bud Bledsoe, the outlaw, had not ventured to affix his
      own name, but the big whiskey bottle left little doubt as to who had been
      Grady&rsquo;s companion in the canyon overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miscreants had departed&mdash;the tracks of two men were clearly shown
      at a little distance from those left by Roderick and the Major. They had
      ascended the gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have them trapped like coyotes,&rdquo; declared the Major,
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; remarked Grant Jones.
      &ldquo;If there is one man in this region who knows the mountain trails
      and mountain craft it is Bud Bledsoe. He&rsquo;ll get out of a box canyon
      where you or I would either break our necks to a certainty or remain like
      helpless frogs at the bottom of a well. Then I&rsquo;ve got another idea&mdash;a
      fancy, perhaps, but I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;just&mdash;know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke slowly, an interval between each word, conning the chances while
      he prolonged his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea?&rdquo; asked Roderick. But the Major waited
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Grant&rsquo;s face lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by jingo,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that may be their plan. If
      they can get over the range on to the Ferris-Haggerty road they may make
      Rawlins by the western route. That&rsquo;s why they may have gone up the
      canyon instead of returning by the cave. For they came in by the cave; it
      is you they followed yesterday, Major, into the valley. The tracks show
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already satisfied myself on that point,&rdquo; replied Buell
      Hampton. &ldquo;I have no doubt, since we balked Bledsoe in his previous
      attempt, that he has been on my tracks ever since, determined to find out
      where I got the rich ore. But it surprises me that a man in Grady&rsquo;s
      position should have descended to be the associate of such a notorious
      highwayman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, moral turpitude makes strange bedfellows,&rdquo; said Grant,
      pointing to the depressions where the two claim-jumpers had slept &ldquo;But
      there is no use in indulging in conjectures at the present time. I&rsquo;ve
      a proposal to make.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear it,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily I brought my skis with me, strapped to one of the burros.
      Didn&rsquo;t know when they might come handy amid all this snow. Well, I&rsquo;ll
      go back to the hut, and I&rsquo;ll cut across the range, and will
      intercept these damned robbers, if that&rsquo;s their game, to a
      certainty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather risky,&rdquo; remarked Buell Hampton. &ldquo;Feels like more
      snow.&rdquo; And he sniffed the ambient air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be all right. And you&rsquo;ve got to take risks
      too. I&rsquo;ll give Roderick my rifle, Major, and you take your own. You
      can follow the trail of these men, and if they have got out of the canyon,
      then you can get out the same way too. If so, we&rsquo;ll all meet on the
      range above. Roderick, you know where the Dillon Trail crosses the
      Ferris-Haggerty Road?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t miss each other if we all make for that point.
      And if you don&rsquo;t arrive by noon, I&rsquo;ll go right on to Rawlins
      by the western road, and lodge our location papers. I&rsquo;ll know you
      have Bledsoe and Grady trapped and are holding the ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds feasible,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;But first of all we&rsquo;ve
      got to tear down these fraudulent location notices and put our own up
      again.&rdquo; He pointed to one of the corner stakes. &ldquo;Just look&mdash;these
      claim-jumpers came provided with regular printed forms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go ahead with that right now,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;No
      doubt the papers have been changed too down on the Major&rsquo;s ground.
      When you&rsquo;re through with that job, follow the trail up the canyon.
      Now I&rsquo;m off for my skis, and then for the road over the hills.
      Good-by. Take care of yourselves. Good-by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And down the valley they heard his voice singing the song of the mountain
      trail:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;As I was coming down the road,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tired team and a heavy load,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I cracked my whip and the leader sprung
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the off horse stepped on the wagon tongue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his figure disappeared round a bend, and all again was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bledsoe and Grady had taken their time in ascending the canyon. But at
      last they reached the impasse that had brought Buell Hampton and Roderick
      to a halt the previous evening and caused them to retrace their steps as
      the tracks revealed. Just as they were discussing whether it might not be
      necessary for them also to turn back, a deer dashed wildly past them on
      the narrow bench where they stood&mdash;so close that they might have
      almost touched it with an outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grady jumped back, frightened by the sudden bound of the swiftly speeding
      animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what that means?&rdquo; asked Bledsoe quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We started the deer, I suppose,&rdquo; stammered Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But someone else did&mdash;lower down the gorge. We are being
      trailed, boss. We&rsquo;ve got to get out of this hole in double-quick
      time or chance being shot down from behind a rock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This wall is impossible,&rdquo; exclaimed Grady, his frightened
      face gazing up the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bledsoe was surveying the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he said at last. Then he swung his lariat,
      the noose of which, going straight to its mark, caught a projecting tree
      stump full fifty feet above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can make that,&rdquo; he added, as he pulled the rope tight,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a ledge running right around and up&mdash;see?&rdquo;
      He pointed with his finger, tracing a line along the rocky wall. &ldquo;Now
      up you go. I&rsquo;ll hold the rope. It&rsquo;s dead easy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grady dropped his rifle, and with both hands began to climb. Weighted with
      the gold in his pockets, he made the ascent slowly and laboriously. But at
      last he gained the ledge, and scrambling now on hands and knees as he
      moved further upward and onward he speedily disappeared over the rim of
      the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Bledsoe&rsquo;s lips was a smile of cold contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I wanted him to pull up the junk
      first. However, I&rsquo;ll manage, I guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to tie to the riata his own and Grady&rsquo;s rifle. Then he
      swung himself aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not half way up when a rifle bullet flattened itself on the
      rock not a foot from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; came a voice from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, ain&rsquo;t they up now?&rdquo; muttered the outlaw grimly,
      as he jerked himself to a higher foothold. A few more springs and he was
      standing on the ledge. Then, when a second bullet knocked off his hat, he
      ducked and scurried along the narrow footway almost as quickly as Grady
      had done, and was gone from the view of the two riflemen lower down the
      canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to
      have any guns. We&rsquo;ll get them yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton followed to the foot of the cliff. The rifles tied to the
      lariat showed that the fugitives were in truth disarmed, so far at least
      as long-distance weapons were concerned. The Major carefully hid the
      rifles in a clump of brushwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now prepared to follow, but caution had to be used, for Bud
      Bledsoe no doubt had a brace of revolvers at his belt. Roderick climbed up
      the rope first, while Buell Hampton, with his Springfield raised, kept
      watch for the slightest sign of an enemy above. But the fugitives had not
      lingered. Roderick, from the edge of the cliff, called on the Major to
      make the ascent, and a few minutes later they stood side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      High up on the snow-clad face of the mountain were the fleeing figures of
      Grady and Bledsoe. Yes, they were making in the direction of the
      Ferris-Haggerty Road. Grant would certainly intercept them, while Roderick
      and the Major stalked the quarry from the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to get that thousand-dollar reward for Bud Bledsoe&rsquo;s
      hide,&rdquo; laughed Roderick, slipping a cartridge into the chamber of
      his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not shoot to kill,&rdquo; replied the Major. &ldquo;It will
      be sufficient that they surrender. We have them at our mercy. Come along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced a few paces, then paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I do not like this snow.&rdquo;
      He held out his hand, and a first soft feathery flake settled on his palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well be all right,&rdquo; cried Roderick. &ldquo;Besides we&rsquo;ve
      got to help Grant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They trudged along, walking zig-zag up the hill to lessen the incline, but
      always keeping close to the trail of the men they were pursuing. On the
      plateau above the snow lay deeper, and at places they were knee-deep in
      the drift, their feet breaking through the thin encrusting surface which
      frost had hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity we have not web snowshoes or skis,&rdquo; remarked
      Buell Hampton when they had paused to draw breath. &ldquo;We could make so
      much better time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the other fellows are no better equipped than ourselves,&rdquo;
      replied Roderick, philosophically. &ldquo;But, by jingo, it&rsquo;s
      snowing some now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the feathery flakes were all around them, not blindingly thick as
      yet, but certain precursors of the coming storm. The trail was still quite
      clear although the fugitives were no longer in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed, two hours, three hours&mdash;and hunters and hunted still
      plodded on. Roderick felt no misgivings, for he could tell from the lie of
      the hills that they were making steadily for the junction of the
      Ferris-Haggerty Road with the track over the range to Dillon, where Grant
      Jones would now be waiting. But at last the snow began to fall more
      thickly, and the encircling mountains came to be no longer visible. Even
      the guiding footprints were becoming filled up and difficult to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Buell Hampton stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men have lost their way,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are going round in a circle. Look here&mdash;they have crossed
      their own track.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are we to do?&rdquo; asked Roderick. &ldquo;I suppose we
      hardly know where we are ourselves now,&rdquo; he added, looking uneasily
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my pocket compass&mdash;luckily I never travel without it in
      the mountains. But I think it is prudent that we should lose no further
      time in making for Encampment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Grant Jones?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can look after himself. He is on skis, and knows every foot of
      the Dillon trail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Grady and Bledsoe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their fate is in other hands. If we follow them any longer we will
      undoubtedly be caught in the storm ourselves.&rdquo; He held a hand aloft.
      &ldquo;See, the wind is rising. There will be heavy drifting before long.&rdquo;
      Roderick now felt the swirl of driven snow on his cheeks. Yes, the wind
      had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll endeavor to save them,&rdquo; continued Buell
      Hampton. &ldquo;Perhaps, as they are circling round, they are not far away
      from this spot even now. We will try at all events.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And raising both hands to form a voice trumpet, he uttered a loud: &ldquo;Hallo
      I hallo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But no answer came. Again he shouted, again and yet again, turning round
      in all directions. Everything remained silent and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major now glanced at his compass, and took his bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; was all he said, as he led the way through the loose
      crisp snow that crunched and cheeped beneath their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the storm by some strange vagary abated. The wind was
      blowing stronger, but it seemed to be driving the snow-laden clouds up
      into the higher mountain elevations. All of a sudden a penetrating shaft
      of sunshine flashed through the dancing snow-flakes, then the flakes
      themselves ceased to fall, and the sun was shining on the virgin mantle of
      white that enveloped range and peaks as far as the eye could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick glanced down the mountain side. Almost beneath his feet was
      Conchshell Ranch&mdash;he could see the home on the little knoll amid the
      clustering pine trees. For the moment he was thinking of Gail. But the
      hand of Buell Hampton had clutched his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Roderick looked&mdash;away in the direction of Cow Creek Canyon, a
      mighty gash in the flank of the mountains nearly a thousand feet deep and
      more than half a mile across. Standing out, clear and distinct in the
      bright sunshine, were the tall twin towers on either side of the gorge,
      supporting the great steel cable which bridged the chasm and carried the
      long string of iron buckets bringing ore from the Ferris-Haggerty mine,
      fourteen miles distant, down into the smelter at Encampment. Roderick at
      his first glance saw that the aerial cars, despite the recent snow-storm,
      were still crawling across the deep canyon, for all the world like huge
      spiders on a strand of gossamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as his eyes swept the landscape he beheld outlined on the white
      expanse of snow the figures of three men. One, standing fully a hundred
      yards away from the other two and lower down the hill, was the
      gorilla-like form of Bud Bledsoe. The others were Grady and Grant Jones on
      his skis.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Roderick looked, before he could even utter a cry, these two
      figures clutched at each other. For a moment they swayed to and fro, then
      Grant seemed to fling his man away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the same instant, just as a picture might be blotted from a
      screen by cutting off the light, both figures had vanished! Then, like
      steam shot from a geyser, there ascended high into mid-air a great cloud
      of powdered snow, and to the watchers&rsquo; ears came a deep boom
      resembling the prolonged and muffled roar of thunder or big artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! A snow slide!&rdquo; gasped Buell Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was stricken dumb. He stood rigid, frozen with horror. He needed
      no one to tell him that Grant Jones had gone over the rim of the canyon,
      down a thousand feet, smothered under a million tons of snow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;THE PASSING OF GRANT JONES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ARLY the following
      morning several hundred searchers were at the scene of the snow slide in
      Cow Creek Canyon. Every precaution was taken not to have anyone walk along
      near the rim of the gorge a thousand feet above. There were still hundreds
      of thousands of tons of snow on the narrow plateau at the top, which any
      disturbance, even no greater than a stone thrown by the hands of a child,
      might start moving. If another slide should occur it would overwhelm and
      crush the intrepid searchers below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A systematic probing of the snow with long iron rods had been begun at
      once and kept up perseveringly until three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
      Then one of the searchers touched clothing or something with his rod. The
      snow was quickly shoveled aside, and at a depth of about seven feet the
      body of Grant Jones was found lying flat upon his back with his right arm
      stretched out above his head, the left doubled under him. The face was
      quite natural&mdash;it wore a peaceful smile. None of his clothing had
      been disturbed or tom&mdash;even his cap and his skis were in place. The
      poor fellow had simply been crushed to death or smothered by the many tons
      of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately a makeshift sled was constructed by strapping two skis
      together sideways. On this the body was taken up the steep hills by a
      cautiously selected route to Battle, three and a half miles away, and
      thence on to Encampment, twelve miles farther, the improvised sled being
      drawn all the way by strong and willing men of the hills. Accompanying the
      remains were Roderick Warfield, Jim Rankin, Boney Earnest, and other
      faithful friends, while following came a great cortege of miners, mill
      hands, and mountaineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight before the mournful procession reached town. And awaiting
      it even at that late hour was a dense crowd, standing with bared heads and
      tear-stained faces. For in all the hill country the name of Grant Jones
      was a household word. His buoyant good-nature was recognized by everyone,
      and probably he did not have an enemy in all southern Wyoming where his
      brief manhood life had been spent. Fully a thousand people, of both sexes,
      of all classes and all ages, formed the escort of the little funeral sled
      on its last stage to the undertaker&rsquo;s establishment. Here the body
      was received by Major Buell Hampton and the Reverend Stephen Grannon. It
      had been the Major&rsquo;s duty that day to seek out the clergyman and
      bring him down in a sledge from the hills to administer the last sad rites
      for their dear dead friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the search was resumed for Grady&rsquo;s remains. Bud Bledsoe it
      was known had escaped&mdash;the Major had seen him running downhill after
      the disaster and others had tracked his footprints, to lose them in a
      clump of timber. So there was only one more body to be recovered. The task
      of probing with the long iron rods went on for several hours. The
      searchers knew the necessity of working both carefully and with speed, for
      another snow slide was imminent. And at last it came, toward the noon hour.
      But warning had been passed along, so that no lives were sacrificed, the
      only result being to pile a veritable mountain of snow over the spot where
      Grady&rsquo;s body presumably lay. The search was abandoned, without
      regret on anyone&rsquo;s part; in the spring the avalanche would give up
      its dead; until then the mortal remains of the unpopular and disgraced
      capitalist could well remain in their temporary sepulchre of snow, &ldquo;unwept,
      unhonored, and unsung.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But for Grant Jones there was public mourning, deep, sincere, and solemn.
      Toward evening the whole town of Encampment seemed to be wending their way
      to the little church where the Reverend Stephen Gran-non was to preach the
      funeral sermon. And these are the words which the venerable Flockmaster
      spoke to the hushed and sorrowing congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, our hearts today commune with the battalions who have
      &lsquo;crossed over.&rsquo; Love broods above the sleeping dust in a
      service of tears. The past is a dream&mdash;the future a mystery.
      Sometimes the tides of dissolution creep upon us silently. Again they are
      as stormy seas and rough breakers that sweep all with reckless cruelty
      into oblivion. But whether the parting be one way or the other, in
      peacefulness or in the savagery of a storm, to loving hearts it is ever a
      tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grief which is ours today is as old as the ages. It brings us
      into fellowship with the centuries. We know now why Eve wept for Abel and
      David lamented Absalom. Death is the most ancient sculptor in the world.
      Ever since men lived and died, death has made each grave a gallery and
      filled it with a silent statue. Death hides faults and magnifies virtues.
      Death conceals the failings of those who have passed while lovingly and
      enduringly chiselling their noble traits of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Centuries of philosophy have not succeeded in reconciling men to
      the sorrows of dissolution. Death makes us all equal with a mutual sorrow.
      We cannot forget our friend who rests here in his final sleep. In happy
      symbolism his shroud was whitest snow, and love thrills our hearts with
      sympathetic memory. Such love is the kindest service of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Affection for those who have departed has built the mausoleums of
      the world and makes every monument an altar of grief. Whether the hope of
      immortality is a revelation or an intuition is not under consideration
      today. Each man believeth for himself. We know that primitive man away
      back in Egypt buried his dead on the banks of the Nile and thought of
      immortality. We know that love throughout the ages has touched the heart
      with its wings, and hope from the beginning to the end whispers to us that
      &lsquo;if a man die he shall live again.&rsquo; I believe that the
      doctrine of evolution gives a potent hope of immortality. Evolution takes
      the mud of the lake and makes a water lily&mdash;the hollow reed in the
      hand of the savage grows into a modern flute&mdash;the rude marks of
      primitive man in the stone age become poems and anthems in our own age. If
      mist can become stars&mdash;if dust can become worlds&mdash;if the
      immortality of biology is a truism&mdash;if love can come from sensations,
      if the angel of the brain can spring into being from simple cells, why
      then cannot the soul endure forever although undergoing transitions in the
      course of its divine development?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in the immortality of the soul. I believe in the religion
      of humanity. Yes, on the far away rim of eternity, Faith seeks a beckoning
      hand and the human heart pulses anew with inspiration and unfaltering
      belief in the immortality of the soul. Let us believe there are songs sung
      and harps touched and kisses given and greetings exchanged in that other
      world. It is better that all other words should turn to ashes upon the
      lips of man rather than the word immortality. Our hearts once filled with
      this belief&mdash;this great truth&mdash;then every tear becomes a jewel,
      the darkest night flees before the breaking dawn and every hope turns into
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before us, my friends, lies the dust of the dead&mdash;Grant Jones.
      Away from home&mdash;away from father and mother, brother and sister&mdash;far
      up in these hills where the shoulders of the mountains are clothed with
      treacherous banks of sliding snow&mdash;he was here seeking to carve out a
      destiny for himself, in the morning of early manhood. The Kismet of his
      life, clothed in mystery, caused him to lay down his tools and leave to
      others his but partially accomplished mission. He was journeying upward
      toward life&rsquo;s mountain-crest&mdash;already the clouds were below him
      and the stars about him. For do we not know from his gifted writings that
      this man held communion with the gods? His heart beat full of loftiest
      hope. And then&mdash;even before high twelve&mdash;he fell asleep. He is
      gone; but a myriad of memories of his achievements gather thick about us.
      We see him as he was, and this virion will abide with us throughout the
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a student and a scholar. He read books that had souls in
      them&mdash;he read books that converse with the hearts of men and speak to
      them of an exalted life&mdash;a life that unfolds an ethical and a higher
      duty incumbent upon the children of men. He knew much about the literature
      of his day&mdash;was acquainted with the great authors through their
      writings. Keats was his favorite poet, Victor Hugo his favorite prose
      author and &lsquo;Les Misérables&rsquo; his favorite book. Music had a
      thrilling charm for him. To his heart it was the language of the eternal.
      He heard songs in the rocks of towering cliffs, in primeval forests, in
      deep gorges, in night winds, in browned grasses and in tempestuous storms
      and in the pebbled mountain brooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need have no fear for his future, my friends&mdash;with him all
      is well. A heroic soul, a matchless man, cannot be lost. His heart was a
      fountain of love. Virtue was his motto&mdash;hope his star&mdash;love his
      guide. Farewell, Grant, farewell. When with the silent boatman we too shall
      cross the river of death and steal away into the infinite, we believe that
      you will be standing there in the rosy dawn of eternity to welcome us, to
      renew the sweet ties of love and friendship that here on earth have bound
      our hearts to yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke the Reverend Stephen Grannon, the Flockmaster of the Hills.

      CHAPTER XXXV.&mdash;A CALL TO SAN FRANCISCO
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>OROTHY mourned for
      Grant Jones&mdash;for days she wept and would not be consoled. Roderick
      had not seen her since the disaster; when he had called at the ranch
      Barbara had brought a message from her room that she dared not trust
      herself yet to speak to anyone, least of all to the one whom she knew to
      have been Grant&rsquo;s closest and dearest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick had now taken apartments in the Bonhomme Hotel&mdash;it would
      have been too heartrending an experience to return to the shack where
      everything was associated with the memory of his lost comrade. It had been
      his painful task to pack the books, the little ornaments, the trophies of
      the chase, the other odds and ends of sacred relics, and send them back
      East to the old folks at home. He had known it to have been Grant&rsquo;s
      own wish that, when death should come, his body should rest among the
      hills of Wyoming. So when a simple headstone had been placed on the grave
      in God&rsquo;s acre at Encampment, the last sad duty had been performed.
      Grief was now deadened. The sweet pleasures of fond reminiscence remained,
      the richest legacy that man can leave behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton and Roderick never met without speaking of Grant, without
      recalling some pleasant episode in their association, some brilliant or
      thoughtful contribution he had made to their past conversations. With the
      aid of fragments of torn paper that had been clutched in the dead man&rsquo;s
      left hand, the hand that had been doubled under him when the body was
      found, they had pieced together the story of that fateful encounter with
      Grady. The latter, bent on discovering and jumping Buell Hampton&rsquo;s
      secret mine, had carried into the mountains the proper declaration papers
      in printed forms, with only the blanks to be filled in&mdash;name, date,
      exact location, etc. Grant must have become aware that these papers were
      all ready signed in Grady&rsquo;s pocket&mdash;perhaps in defiance the
      claim-jumper had flaunted them in his face. For the struggle had been for
      the possession of these documents, the torn quarters of which were still
      in Grant&rsquo;s hand when the fatal dislodgement of snow had taken place.
      The full infamy of Grady&rsquo;s long contrived plot was revealed.
      Righteously indeed had he gone to his doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had passed when Roderick found a letter on the breakfast table at
      his hotel. It was from Barbara Shields.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Mr. Warfield:&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I write to tell you that we are going to California&mdash;to
        spend the winter in Los Angeles. We are all sorrow-stricken over the
        great calamity up in the hills, and Dorothy&mdash;the poor dear girl is
        simply stunned. I have known for a long while that she was very fond of
        Grant, but I had no idea of the depths of her feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Papa says Mama and I must start at once and endeavor to cheer up
        Dorothy and help her forget as much as possible the sadness of this
        terrible affair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mr. Bragdon called last night, and is to be our escort to the
        coast. We shall probably return about the first of May. Please accept
        this as an affectionate good-by for the time being from us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With cordial good wishes,

        &ldquo;Barbara.&rdquo;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Meanwhile snow had been descending off and on day after day, until now the
      whole of the mountain country was effectively sealed. Evidently a rigorous
      winter had set in, and it would be many months before Hidden Valley would
      be again accessible. Roderick was not sorry&mdash;the very mention of gold
      and mining had become distasteful to his ears. Even when with the Major,
      they, never now spoke about the secret canyon and its hoarded treasures&mdash;in
      subtle sympathy with each other&rsquo;s feelings the subject was tabooed
      for the present Bud Bledsoe had disappeared from the district, no doubt
      temporarily enriched by the nuggets with which he had filled his pockets.
      In the spring most likely he would return and rally his gang of mountain
      outlaws. But until then there need be no worry about the snow-enshrouded
      claims, the location papers for which had been now duly registered at the
      county seat in the names of their proper owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton had his books and his work for the poor wherewith to occupy
      his mind. Roderick found his consolation at the smelter. Early and late
      now he worked there, learning the practical operations from Boney Earnest,
      mastering the business details with the aid of a trustworthy old clerk
      whose services had been retained as secretary. Boney, having been made the
      choice of his brother foremen in accordance with the new plan of
      operations, was duly confirmed in his position of general manager, while
      Roderick, formally elected vice-president by the board, held the salaried
      and responsible post of managing-director.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hampton withdrew himself more and more into the seclusion of his
      library; he rarely came to the smelter plant; he left everything in
      Roderick&rsquo;s hands once he had become satisfied of the young man&rsquo;s
      aptitude for the work; he was content to read the managing director&rsquo;s
      weekly report showing steady progress all along the line&mdash;increased
      output, decreased operating costs, large reductions in waste and
      breakages, in a word the all-round benefits resulting from friendly
      cooperation between capital and labor, no longer treating each other as
      enemies, but pulling together in happy conjunction and for mutual
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another circumstance contributing to the general harmony of the community
      was the departure of W. Henry Carlisle, the deposed attorney of the
      smelter company. One of Senator Greed&rsquo;s hirelings, Carlisle had been
      rewarded by that master of political jobbery with a judgeship in Alaska.
      Thus was the whole country made to pay the price of shameful underhand
      services that had tainted the very atmosphere and might well have caused
      the man in the moon to hold his nose when crossing the state of Wyoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Carlisle&rsquo;s going put an end to much bitterness and
      squabbling in Encampment, and now month succeeded month in peaceful
      routine. As both smelter and mine were now working Sundays as well as week
      days, Roderick could rarely take a day off&mdash;or at least he would not
      allow himself a day off.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, along with Major Buell Hampton he was the guest of Mr. Shields
      for Christmas Day dinner, and learned the latest news of the exiles in
      California; that mother and daughters were well, Dorothy something like
      her old happy self if chastened with a sorrow that would always leave its
      memory, and all thoroughly enjoying the unaccustomed luxury of a winter of
      warmth and perpetual sunshine. There was another item in Mr. Shields&rsquo;
      budget. Whitley Adams had spent a month in the capital of the southwest,
      had brought along his big touring car, and had given the girls no end of a
      good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What took him to Los Angeles?&rsquo; asked Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, important banking business, Barbara says,&rdquo; replied Mr.
      Shields quite innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick smiled. &ldquo;Would Dorothy be consoled,&rdquo; he asked
      himself. The enterprising youth certainly deserved the prize; Roderick
      recalled the mirthful warning sent to dear old Grant in the latter&rsquo;s
      dilatory courting days about the tempting peach and the risk of a
      plundering hand. Indeed Whitley and Grant had been wonderfully akin in
      their boyish good-nature and irrepressible enthusiasm. With Grant gone, it
      seemed quite natural that Whitley and Dorothy should be drawn together.
      Roderick could wish no greater happiness for Dorothy, no better luck for
      his old college chum. Such was the train of his musing the while Buell
      Hampton and their host were discussing the wonderful growth and unbounded
      future of Los Angeles, the beautiful city of garden homes and cultured
      family life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For New Year&rsquo;s Day Roderick was invited to the Holdens&rsquo; place,
      and spent a delightful afternoon and evening. Gail sang and played, and
      the General seemed to be mightily interested in all the wonderful results
      being achieved at the smelter under the new régime. Gail listened somewhat
      distrait, but when the conversation about ores and fluxes and cupola
      furnaces and all that sort of thing seemed likely to be indefinitely
      prolonged she stole back to her piano and began singing to herself, soft
      and low.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently, while the General meandered on in a disquisition about
      refractory ores, Roderick was no longer paying attention. He was listening
      to the warbling of a thrush in the forest, and his straining ears caught
      the words of the song&mdash;&ldquo;Just a-Wearyin&rsquo; for You.&rdquo; A
      thrill ran through his nerves. He excused himself to the General, and
      crossed over to the piano. Gail instantly changed her song; by a skillful
      transition she was humming now, &ldquo;Ye Banks and Braes o&rsquo; Bonnie
      Dhon.&rdquo; But their eyes met, and she blushed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the following weeks Roderick thought much and often about the
      beautiful Gail Holden, and occasionally now he would relax from business
      duties to enjoy a gallop with her on a sunny afternoon over the foothill
      ranges. They talked on many themes, and, although words of love were as
      yet unspoken, there came to them the quiet sense of happiness in
      companionship, of interest in each other&rsquo;s thoughts and
      undertakings, of mutual understanding that they were already closer and
      dearer to each other than friendship alone could make them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring was now rapidly approaching. The meadowlarks were singing, and the
      grass beginning to grow green in the valleys and foothills, the wild
      flowers to paint the slopes and dells in vivid colors. General Holden had
      several days before gone to San Francisco, to visit his brother there in
      regard to some family business. Gail had been unable to accompany her
      father; she had declared that the little ranch at this season required all
      her attention. To comfort her in her loneliness Roderick had promised to
      go riding with her for an hour or two every afternoon. This pleasant duty
      had been properly fulfilled for several days, and one afternoon, with
      Badger ready saddled in front of his office, the young vice-president of
      the smelter company was just clearing up a few items of business at his
      desk before mounting and taking the road for the Conchshell Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A telegram was laid at his hand. He opened it casually, talking the while
      with Boney Earnest. But when he saw the name on the slip of paper, he
      started erect. The message was from Gail, and had come from Rawlins:
      &ldquo;My father is in hospital, having met with a street accident in San
      Francisco. Have just had time to catch the afternoon train at Rawlins. My
      address will be the Palace Hotel. Will telegraph news about father on
      arrival.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick. &ldquo;She has taken that
      journey alone. And no one to help her in her trouble and sorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no alternative&mdash;he could but wait with all the patience he
      could command for the next day&rsquo;s overland. For he had instantly
      resolved to follow Gail. Like a flash had come the revelation how deeply
      he loved the girl; it had only needed the presence of tribulation to cause
      the long-smouldering spark of the fire divine in his heart to leap into
      flame&mdash;to make him realize that, come weal, come woe, his place now
      was by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon he made all his preparations for departure. The evening he
      spent with Buell Hampton, and frankly told his friend of his great love
      for Gail. The Major listened sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the world loves a lover,&rdquo; he said, a kindly glow upon his
      face. &ldquo;Humanity demands, conscience approves, and good people
      everywhere applaud the genial and glowing warmth of honest love of man for
      maid. And I commend the choice of your heart, Roderick, for surely nowhere
      can be found a finer woman than Gail Holden. Go in and win, and may good
      luck follow you. For friendship&rsquo;s sake, too, I think it highly
      proper you should proceed at once to San Francisco and look after General
      Holden. I hope he is not dangerously hurt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no other information except this telegram,&rdquo; replied
      Roderick. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll surely wire you from San Francisco.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Rankin drove the stage next morning. Roderick took his accustomed
      place on the box seat, and listened to Jim&rsquo;s accustomed flow of
      language on all the local topics of interest. But during the long drive of
      fifty miles there was only one little part of the one-sided conversation
      that Roderick ever remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, siree,&rdquo; Jim said, &ldquo;all the folks is readin&rsquo;
      books these days. I myself have took the craze&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a book
      about the horse out of our new libr&rsquo;y an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be
      dog-busted if I ever knew the critter had so many bones. Tom Sun is readin&rsquo;
      about wool growin&rsquo; in Australia, and is already figgerin&rsquo; on
      gettin&rsquo; over Tasmanian merino blood for his flocks. And I&rsquo;m
      danged if old Wren the saloon-keeper ain&rsquo;t got stuck with a volume
      on temperance. &lsquo;Ten Bar-Rooms in One Night&rsquo;. no, by gunnies,
      that&rsquo;s not it&mdash;&rsquo;Ten Nights in a Bar-Room&rsquo;&mdash;now
      I&rsquo;ve got it right Guess it will do him a power o&rsquo; good too.
      Then all the young fellers have started goin&rsquo; to night classes. I
      tell you the Reverend Grannon with his schools an&rsquo; his libr&rsquo;ies
      is just workin&rsquo; wonders. An&rsquo; who do you think is his right
      hand man, or boy, or devil&mdash;call him which you like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Roderick vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scotty Meisch, that little tad of a cow-puncher you and poor old
      Grant Jones took up and made a printer&rsquo;s devil of. Well, the parson
      got his hooks in him and tells me he&rsquo;s turned out to be a
      first-class organizer&mdash;that&rsquo;s his word. It&rsquo;s Scotty who
      goes around, starts each new lib&rsquo;iy, and sets the machin&rsquo;ry
      goin&rsquo; smooth an&rsquo; proper. It&rsquo;s a case of a round peg in a
      round hole, although who the hell would have thought it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was pleased to hear this good news of Scotty Meisch, but,
      returning to his thoughts about Gail, failed to follow Jim as the latter
      switched off into another line of &ldquo;unbosomings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to be alone at last and in the drawing room of the Pullman car
      which he had reserved by telegraph.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI&mdash;IN THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER a tedious and
      delayed trip of three days and nights Roderick&rsquo;s train steamed onto
      the mole at Oakland. During the last night he had refused to have the
      berth in his drawing room made down, and had lounged and dozed in his
      seat, occasionally peering out of the car window. The hour was late&mdash;almost
      three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The train should have arrived at seven
      o&rsquo;clock the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the usual scramble of disembarking, red-capped porters pressing
      forward to carry hand baggage from the train to the ferryboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last boat to San Francisco will leave in five minutes,&rdquo; was
      shouted from somewhere, and Roderick found himself with his valise in hand
      being pushed along with the throng of passengers who had just alighted
      from the train. Once on the ferryboat, he climbed to the upper deck and
      went well forward for the view. The waters of the bay were illumed with a
      half-crescent moon. Far across, six miles away, was San Francisco with its
      innumerable lights along the waterfront and on the slopes of her hills. To
      the right were Alcatras Island and the lighthouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sharp ping-ping of bells sounded and the great wheels of the boat
      began to turn. Roderick was filled with the excitement of an impatient
      lover. &ldquo;Gail, Gail, Gail,&rdquo; his throbbing heart kept thrumming.
      Would he be able to find her? San Francisco was a strange city to Gail as
      well as to himself. She had been on the train ahead of him, and might by
      this time have left the Palace Hotel, the address her telegram had given.
      But he had learned from one of the porters that Gail&rsquo;s train had
      been greatly delayed and would not have arrived before eleven o&rsquo;clock
      the previous night. He reasoned that she would perforce have gone to the
      hotel at such a late hour, and would wait until morning to hunt up the
      hospital where her father was being cared for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat had hardly touched the slip and the apron been lowered than he
      bounded forward, hastened through the ferryhouse and came out into the
      open where he was greeted by the tumultuous calls of a hundred solicitous
      cab-drivers. Roderick did not stand on the order of things, but climbing
      into the first vehicle that offered directed to be taken to the Palace
      Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the hotel Roderick paid his fare while the door porter took
      possession of his grips. Glancing at a huge clock just over the cashier&rsquo;s
      desk, he noticed the hour was three-thirty a. m. Taking the pen handed to
      him by the rooming clerk, he signed his name on the register, and then let
      his eyes glance backward over the names of recent arrivals. Ah, there was
      the signature of Gail Holden. Fortune was favoring him and he breathed a
      silent prayer of thankfulness that he had overtaken her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would serve her. He would help her. She should see and she should
      know without his telling her, that nothing else mattered if he could only
      be with her, near her and permitted to relieve her of all troubles and
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show the gentleman to his room,&rdquo; said the night clerk and
      bowed to Roderick with a cordial good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roderick turned and followed the boy to the elevator, he realized that
      he was not sleepy&mdash;indeed that he was nervously alert and wide awake.
      After the boy had brought a pitcher of ice-water to the room, received his
      tip and departed, Roderick sat down to think it all over. But what was the
      use? &ldquo;I cannot see her until perhaps eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning. However, I will be on the outlook and in waiting when she is
      ready for breakfast. And then&mdash;&rdquo; his heart was beating fast
      &ldquo;I certainly am terribly upset,&rdquo; he acknowledged to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking up his hat, he went out, locked the door, rang for the elevator and
      a minute later was out on the street. He was still wearing his costume of
      the mountains&mdash;coat, shirt, trousers, and puttees, all of khaki, with
      a broad-brimmed sombrero to match. A little way up Market Street he
      noticed a florist&rsquo;s establishment. Great bouquets of California
      roses were in the windows, chrysanthemums and jars of violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on, deciding to provide himself later on with a floral offering
      wherewith to decorate the breakfast table. He had often heard San
      Francisco described as a city that turned night into day, and the truth of
      the remark impressed him. Jolly crowds were going along the streets
      singing in roistering fashion&mdash;everyone seemed to be good-natured&mdash;the
      cafés were open, the saloon doors swung both ways and were evidently ready
      for all-comers. When he came to Tate&rsquo;s restaurant, he went down the
      broad marble steps and found&mdash;notwithstanding the lateness or rather
      earliness of the hour&mdash;several hundred people still around the supper
      tables. The scene had the appearance of a merry banquet where everyone was
      talking at the same time. An air of joviality pervaded the place. The
      great fountain was throwing up glittering columns of water through colored
      lights as varied as the tints of a rainbow. The splash of the waters, the
      cool spray, the wealth of ferns and flowers surrounding this sunken garden
      in the center of a great dining room&mdash;the soft strains of the
      orchestra, all combined to fill Roderick with wonder that was almost awe.
      He sank into a chair at a vacant little table near the fountain and
      endeavored to comprehend it all He was fresh from the brown hills, from
      the gray and purple sage and the desert cacti, from the very heart of
      nature, so utterly different to this spectacle of a bacchanalian
      civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wilderness waif soon discovered that he would be de trop unless he
      responded to the urgent inquiries of the waiter as to what he would have
      to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bottle of White Rock to begin with,&rdquo; ordered Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was sipping the cold and refreshing water it occurred to him that he
      had not tasted food since breakfast the day before in the dining car of
      the train. Yes, he would have something to eat and he motioned to the
      waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After giving his order he had to wait a long time, and the longer he
      waited the hungrier he became. Presently a generous steak was placed
      before him. Potatoes <i>au gratin,</i> olives, asparagus, and French peas
      made up the side dishes, and a steaming pot of coffee completed a
      sumptuous meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had paid his check he discovered it was almost five o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning, and as he mounted the marble stairway he laughingly told
      himself he wouldn&rsquo;t have much of an appetite at seven or eight o&rsquo;clock
      when he came to sit down at the breakfast table with Gail Holden. Gaining
      the sidewalk he found that darkness was shading into dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of returning by way of Market Street, Roderick lit a cigar and
      turning to the right walked up a cross street toward the St. Francis
      Hotel. In front was a beautiful little park; shrubbery and flowers lined
      the winding walks, while here and there large shade trees gave an added
      touch of rural charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself on one of the iron benches, took out his watch and
      counted up the number of minutes until, probably, he would see the object
      of his heart&rsquo;s desire. How slow the time was going. He heard the
      laughter of a banqueting party over at the Poodle Dog, although at the
      time he did not know the place by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;San Francisco is certainly in a
      class by itself. This is the land where there is no night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between the scenes in this gay city and the quiet hill life
      away up among the crags, the deep canyons and snow-clad peaks of southern
      Wyoming was indeed remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the morning of April eighteen, 1906, and the night had almost
      ended. There was a suggestion of purple on the eastern horizon&mdash;the
      forerunner of coming day. The crescent moon was hanging high above Mt.
      Tamalpais.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town clock tolled the hour of five and still Roderick waited.
      Presently he was filled with a strange foreboding, a sense of oppression,
      that he was unable to analyze. He wondered if it presaged refusal of the
      great love surging in his heart for Gail Holden, the fair rider of the
      ranges, the sweet singer of the hills. An indescribable agitation seized
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes went slowly by. His impatience increased. He looked again at
      his watch and it was only a quarter after five. The city was wrapped in
      slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly and without warning Roderick was roughly thrown from his
      seat and sent sprawling onto the grass among the shrubbery. He heard an
      angry growling like the roar from some rudely awakened Goliath of
      destruction deep down in earth&rsquo;s inner chambers of mystery&mdash;a
      roar of wrath and madness and resistless power. The ground was trembling,
      reeling, upheaving, shaking and splitting open into yawning fissures,
      while hideous noises were all around. Buildings about the park were being
      rent asunder and were falling into shapeless heaps of ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struggling to his feet, his first impulse was to hasten to the hotel and
      protect Gail. As he arose and started to run he was again thrown to earth.
      The bushes whipped the turf as if swished to and fro by an unseat hand.
      For a moment Roderick was stunned into inaction&mdash;stricken with the
      paralysis of unspeakable fear.

      CHAPTER XXXVII&mdash;RODERICK RESCUES GAIL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS but a few
      seconds until Roderick was again on his feet Hurriedly taking his
      bearings, he started off through the little park in the direction of the
      Palace Hotel. In the uncertain morning dawn the people from innumerable
      bedrooms above the stores were pouring into the streets. They were
      scantily attired, most of them simply in their night garments, and all
      were dazed and stunned with a terrible fright Before Roderick had reached
      Market Street the thoroughfare was almost blocked by this frantic and
      half-clothed mass of humanity. His powerful athletic frame and his
      football experience stood him in good stead, although here roughness had
      to be exchanged for greatest gentleness. He was very persistent, however,
      in his determination to reach the hotel in time if possible to be of
      assistance to Gail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than ten feet in front of where he was crowding his way through the
      throng of people a portion of a cornice came tumbling down from far above.
      A wailing cry went up from the unfortunates pinned beneath. Roderick
      leaped quickly forward and with the strength of a Hercules began to heave
      aside the great blocks of stone. Others recognized his leadership,
      instantly obeyed his commands and lent their united strength in helping to
      release three men who had been caught under debris. The cries of the
      injured were piteous. Indifferent to the danger of falling bricks and
      mortar Roderick caught up one poor fellow in his arms and carried him as
      if he were a babe into a receding doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My legs, my legs,&rdquo; the victim moaned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      broken&mdash;they&rsquo;re broken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly removing his coat Roderick placed it beneath the man&rsquo;s head
      for a pillow, and leaving others to guard, he hastened back to the scene
      of the tragedy, only to find that the spark of life had now gone out from
      the other two bodies pitifully maimed and crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed his way into the middle of the street amid the surging mob, and
      again turned his steps toward the Palace Hotel. At last he found himself
      near to the entrance of the great hostelry. But everyone was seeking to
      escape and rushing to the street in riotous disorder. By dint of
      indefatigable efforts he managed to get within the gateway and then to the
      large trysting room across the hall from the hotel office. A group of
      women were endeavoring to revive a poor sufferer who evidently had
      fainted. Approaching, he saw blood coursing down the fair face of the
      unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is Gail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later he had gently pushed the helpers aside and gathered the
      girl in his strong arms. Moving backwards, forcing a passage step by step
      with the determination of one who acts intuitively in a crisis, he managed
      to gain the open. He hoped the air would restore Gail to consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing to the other side of the street where the throng was less dense
      he started toward a high hill that rose up far away. It was covered with
      residences, and if he could once reach that vantage point with his charge
      he felt sure it would be an asylum of safety. The distance was
      considerable and presently the way became steep. But he was unconscious of
      any weight in the burden he carried. His only thought was to get Gail away
      from the burning, falling buildings&mdash;away from the central part of
      the city which was now a fiery pit wrapped in sheets of devouring flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally attaining the eminence&mdash;it was Nob Hill although he did not
      know the name&mdash;he found the porches and front lawns of the beautiful
      houses filled with frightened people viewing the scene in awe and
      amazement. Formalities were forgotten; solicitude and helpful kindness
      reigned supreme among all the people of the stricken city.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called to a little group huddled on the front porch of their home.
      &ldquo;Here is a lady,&rdquo; Roderick explained, &ldquo;who has been
      injured and fainted. Will you please get water and help to revive her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In hurried eagerness to assist they quickly brought a cot to the porch and
      upon this Roderick gently placed the still unconscious girl. Her face was
      deathly white, and a great red gash was discovered across one side of her
      head, from which the blood was trickling down the marble cheek. The wound
      was bandaged by tender hands and the face laved with cooling water. After
      a little Gail opened her eyes and asked piteously: &ldquo;Where am I?
      Where am I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are safe,&rdquo; said Roderick as he knelt by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it you, Mr. Warfield? How glad&mdash;how glad I am to see
      you. Where am I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In San Francisco. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I remember now,&rdquo; she replied weakly and lifted one
      hand to her aching head. &ldquo;But papa?&mdash;where is my father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to look for him now. You are with kind people and they
      will care for you. Rest quietly and be patient until I return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dark blue eyes looked helplessly up into his for a moment; then he
      turned and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick rushed down the hill, back to the scene of devastation where he
      might be useful in helping to save human life, determined also in his
      heart to find General Holden. But where was he? In some hospital, as Gail&rsquo;s
      telegram had told.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was debating with himself whether he should return to seek some
      directions from Gail. But just then the surging, swaying crowd pushed him
      irresistibly back, then swept him away along Market Street. The Palace
      Hotel was on fire. Policemen and firemen were thrusting the people away
      from the known danger line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then he heard a voice crying out in heart-rending anguish: &ldquo;My
      little girl&rsquo;, my little girl.&rdquo; It was a frantic mother weeping
      and looking far up to the seventh story of a building she evidently had
      just left. There leaning out of a window was a curly haired tot of a
      child, perhaps not more than four years old, laughing and throwing kisses
      toward her mama, all unconscious of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came down,&rdquo; sobbed the weeping mother to those around,
      &ldquo;to see what had happened. The stairway is now on fire, and I cannot
      return. Will no one, oh Lord, will no one save my little girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick looked up to where the woman was pointing and saw the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;smoke is coming out of the next
      window.&rdquo; He noticed that the adjoining building was already a mass
      of fire. At a glance he took in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a minute,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an outside fire escape that led from the top story down to the
      first floor. Roderick made a leap, caught hold of the awning braces,
      pulled himself up with muscles of steel, and grasped the lowermost rung of
      the escape. A moment later he was making his way up the narrow iron
      ladder, pushing through the aperture at each floor, with almost superhuman
      swiftness. When he reached the window he lifted the child in his arms and
      hastily started on the downward journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold tight, little girl,&rdquo; was all Roderick said as he felt
      the confiding clasp of her tiny arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the people below besides the almost frenzied mother were watching
      the heroic deed with bated breath. Just then a cry of terror went up. The
      great wall of a burning building across the street was toppling outward
      and a moment later collapsed, burying many unhappy victims beneath the
      avalanche of broken brick and mortar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the little girl&rsquo;s mother had been caught by the falling wall
      or not Roderick had no means of determining. A choking cloud of dust, ash,
      soot and smoke enveloped him in stifling darkness; he could hardly
      breathe. The very air was heated and suffocating. But down and down he
      went with his little burden clinging tightly to him. Arriving at the
      awnings he swung himself over, secured a momentary foothold, then grasped
      the braces with his hands and dropped to the littered sidewalk below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother of the girl was nowhere to be seen. He turned down the street
      to get away from the horrible sight of the dead and the piteous cries of
      the dying. He had scarcely reached the next corner when the child, who was
      mutely clinging to him as if indeed she knew he was her savior, released
      her arms and called out gleefully: &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s mama, mama,
      mama.&rdquo; Then the mother stood before him, weeping now for joy, and
      through her tears Roderick saw a face of radiance and a smile of gratitude
      that time or eternity would never erase from his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing mattered now&mdash;her little girl was safe in her arms. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know who you are, sir,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;but I owe
      to you the life of my child, and may the good God bless you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was no time for thanks. Roderick was looking upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come quickly,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;come this way&mdash;hasten.&rdquo;
      And he pulled them down a side street and away from another sky-scraper
      that was trembling and wavering as if about to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned, and ran along a street that was still free from fire and led
      toward the St. Francis Hotel and the little park fronting it where
      Roderick had sat at dawn. Carefully he guided the woman&rsquo;s steps,
      keeping to the middle of the street, for the sidewalk was encumbered with
      debris and threatened by partly dislodged brickwork above. Here and there
      the roadway was rumpled and rough as a washboard by reason of the
      earthquake, while at places were great gaping fissures where the earth had
      been split open many feet deep. But soon they were in the open square, and
      mother and child were safe. Knowing this, Roderick allowed them to pass on&mdash;to
      pass out of his life without even the asking or the giving of names.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there was other work to his hand; he hurried back to the last
      crossing. There under the fallen débris, was a woman obviously of
      refinement and wealth whose life had been vanquished without warning. One
      hand was extended above the wreckage. It was shapely and encircled with a
      bracelet, while a single diamond solitaire ring adorned her finger&mdash;perhaps
      a betrothal ring. Two human ghouls&mdash;not men&mdash;had whipped out
      their ready knives and were in the very act of severing the finger to
      obtain the jewel. It was these brutes that Roderick had come back to face.
    </p
    <p>
      Like a flash he leaped forward and with a well directed sledge-hammer blow
      felled one of these would-be robbers of the dead. Then he grappled with
      the second scoundrel. The man in his grip was none other than the outlaw,
      Bud Bledsoe!
    </p>
    <p>
      With knife already open and in his hand the inhuman wretch slashed
      Roderick&rsquo;s cheek, and the red blood spurted down his face and neck.
      Roderick loosed his hold and stepped back a pace&mdash;the next gash of
      this kind might easily be a fatal one. But not for one instant did he lose
      his presence of mind or nerve. As the cowardly miscreant advanced, cruel
      murder in his eyes, Roderick by a swift swing of his right parried the
      upraised hand that held the knife, and then, seizing the opening, he
      delivered with his left a smashing uppercut. Bledsoe reeled for a moment
      like a drunken man, then sank to the ground a huddled heap, and finally
      rolled over kicking convulsively and quite insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knockout had been effected quickly and well&mdash;like a butcher would
      fell a bullock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the devastated city was under martial law, and three or four
      soldiers coming hurriedly up just then, and having seen from the opposite
      corner the hellish attempt of the two wretches to despoil the dead, shot
      them instantly, Bledsoe where he lay writhing, the other as he staggered
      dazed-like to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick wiped the blood from his face, and thanked the soldiers. &ldquo;Good
      for you, young fellow,&rdquo; cried one of them as they continued on their
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wound forgotten, Roderick again looked round to see where he could
      render the most efficient service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night came on, and he was still at work, rescuing and helping. He had
      been recognized by the Citizens&rsquo; Committee of Safety and now wore a
      badge that gave him the freedom of the streets. In all his goings and
      comings he was ever looking for General Holden, and he also made numerous
      trips to Nob Hill, searching for the house where he had left Gail. But he
      could never find the place again, for the raging fire was fast
      obliterating all guiding landmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus for two days&mdash;terrible days, pitiful days&mdash;for two nights&mdash;terrible
      nights, pitiful nights&mdash;Roderick drifted with the bands of rescuers,
      doing deeds of valor and of helpfulness for others less strong than
      himself. His face was black with soot and clotted with blood, his coat he
      had parted with at the beginning of the disaster, the rest of his clothing
      was tattered and torn, his sombrero had disappeared, when and how he had
      not the faintest notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire had now burned out its center circle and was eating away at the
      rim in every direction. Roderick suddenly remembered he had tasted no food
      since his early breakfast at Tate&rsquo;s an hour before the earthquake
      crash. The pangs of hunger had begun to make themselves felt, and he
      concluded to turn his steps toward the outer fire line and endeavor to
      find something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked along from house to house he found them all deserted. Some of
      the household goods were scattered about the lawns, while boxes, trunks,
      and bulky packages were piled on the sidewalks. Presently he found a
      basket which contained a single loaf of bread. This he ate ravenously, and
      counted it the greatest feast he had ever had in his life. He ate as he
      hurried along, thinking of Gail and General Holden&mdash;wishing he might
      divide the bread with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roar of consuming, crackling flames, the deep intonations of
      intermittent dynamite explosions, and the occasional wail of human beings
      in distress, rose and fell like a funeral dirge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His feet intuitively turned back to the burned district. There might
      yet be more work for him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to pick his way across the ruins, and ascending the hill
      opposite make another desperate effort to find Gail. After a fatiguing
      climb over hot embers and around the twisted steel skeletons of burned-out
      buildings he finally stood on the rim of the hill above the saucer-shaped
      valley of flames. Only charred and smoking ruins were about him. The
      beautiful residential district had like the business sections below, been
      swept with the fires of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was Gail? Was she safe? Was she dead? Would he ever find her? These
      were some of the questions that kept him in agonizing incertitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a weird uncanny attraction about this great amphitheatre of
      flame&mdash;an attraction like that of a lodestone; and he feared lest
      Gail had left her refuge in a vain search for her father and met with
      another serious accident. Roderick had visited all the unburned hospitals,
      but no trace of General Holden had he been able to find. The quest for
      both must be resumed; so down the hill he trudged again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashes and burning cinders were falling like huge flakes of snow. Once more
      Roderick was in the midst of a throng of people&mdash;gaunt and
      hollow-eyed, wearied and worn-out, just staggering along. At last he
      recognized the little park in front of the St. Francis Hotel. Yes, he
      would go there, stretch himself on the grass, and rest and sleep for at
      least a few hours. This would make him ill the fitter for his task of
      searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to cross the street a dozen people shouted for him to
      look out; but he did not turn quickly enough to discover nor escape a
      burning wooden rafter that fell from the upper story of a building and
      struck him an ugly glancing blow on the head. Roderick dropped to the
      ground unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very moment a Red Cross automobile was passing. It stopped
      abruptly at the sidewalk. Two men stepped quickly down and lifted the
      almost lifeless body into the machine. A moment later the auto glided away
      down a side street in the direction of Golden Gate Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night there were many in the camps of refuge around the burning city
      who thought about the tall, strong-muscled, square-jawed young stranger in
      khaki garb, while their hearts welled up with gratitude for his timely
      assistance and chivalrous deeds of bravery. Had they but known of the fate
      that had at last befallen their nameless hero, grateful thoughts would
      have been turned into fervent prayers.

      CHAPTER XXXVIII&mdash;THE SEARCH FOR RODERICK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE general shock
      of horror caused by the San Francisco disaster was intensified at
      Encampment when the news ran round that three local people had been in the
      stricken city at the moment of the earthquake shock which had laid the
      business centre in ruins and prepared the way for the subsequent
      far-sweeping conflagration. No telegram came from either the Holdens or
      Roderick Warfield, and their silence, their failure to relieve the anxiety
      of the friends they must have known were deeply concerned about their
      safety, could only cause ominous conjectures as to their fate. There was
      no possibility of reaching them by wire, for the Palace Hotel, the only
      known address, had been one of the first buildings destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Buell Hampton did not wait for telegrams to reach him. He had no
      sooner been apprised of the catastrophe than he was on his way to Rawlins,
      hiring a special conveyance on the mere off-chance that railway schedules
      would have been disarranged and a train might be caught at any moment. In
      this he showed his usual good judgment for within an hour of reaching the
      station he was on board a belated limited, in which he had the further
      good fortune to find one solitary sleeping berth unoccupied. The train was
      loaded with returning San Francisco people who had been absent when their
      homes had been swept away, anxious friends of sufferers, doctors, nurses,
      relief workers of every kind, newspaper men, all hurrying to the scene of
      sorrow and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the morning of the fifth day after the earthquake that Buell
      Hampton, provided with a special permit, at last found himself amid the
      ruins of San Francisco. Many buildings were still burning or smoldering,
      but the area of destruction was now defined and the spread of the flames
      checked. With saddened heart the Major picked his way along what once had
      been Market Street but was now a long mound of fallen stones, bricks, and
      mortar lined by the skeletons of lofty iron-framed buildings. Here the
      work of clearing away the debris in search of victims was in progress. But
      any inquiries of those actively engaged in these operations were useless.
      Buell Hampton passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he came upon the bread line, a wonderful sight&mdash;a long row
      of people of all sorts and conditions, the rich, the poor, the educated,
      the ignorant, the well dressed, the tattered, ranged in single file and
      marching slowly past the commissary to receive a supply of provisions for
      their own famishing selves or for their destitute families. Buell Hampton
      scanned each face; neither General Holden nor Roderick were in the line,
      nor was there any sign of Gail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began a systematic visitation of the refuge camps that had been
      formed around the bumed-out area. The remainder of that first day he spent
      in Golden Gate Park. It was not until the succeeding afternoon that he
      found himself in the crowded tent city out on the Presidio. Here at last
      his patient and persistent efforts were rewarded. He caught sight of Gail
      seated near the door of a tiny tent-house and strode eagerly forward to
      greet her. In his deep emotion he folded the young girl to his breast, and
      she in turn clung to him in her joy of meeting at last a dear friend from
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your father?&rdquo; was the Major&rsquo;s first inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is safe. We have this little tent, and I am nursing him. His
      right arm was broken in the street accident, but immediately after the
      fire began all the hospital patients were removed to open places, and here
      I found him, thank God, the very first evening. You see, my uncle&rsquo;s
      house was burned. He is quartered across the bay at Oakland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your head is bandaged, Gail. Were you badly hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was nothing,&rdquo; she replied, pulling off the narrow
      band of linen that encircled her brow. &ldquo;Just a little scalp wound
      when I fell, and it is quite healed now. But, oh, I remember so little
      about the terrible disaster&mdash;how I got out of the Palace Hotel at
      all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Roderick&mdash;where is Roderick?&rdquo; asked Buell Hampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail&rsquo;s eyes opened wide&mdash;with wonder, then with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick, Roderick!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a trembling voice.
      &ldquo;Then it was not a dream?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dream?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was he who carried me out of the hotel building and to the
      veranda of the house where he laid me on a cot and kind friends bathed my
      wound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No dream, this. It was Roderick for certain. He followed you on the
      next train to San Francisco&mdash;intending to go straight to the Palace
      Hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Followed me? Why did he follow me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To render you help when your father was hurt&mdash;because he loves
      you&mdash;of course, you must have divined how deeply he loves you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The color rose slowly to Gail&rsquo;s face. But there was fear still in
      her eyes. She pressed her clasped hands to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where is he now?&rdquo; she asked in a tense whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I want to know&mdash;I have been seeking both you and
      him. When did you meet last?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five days ago. After saving me he rushed straight away to seek for
      Papa. I came to believe that it was all a dream. For I have not seen him
      since. Oh, he must have been hurt&mdash;he may have been killed.&rdquo;
      And burying her face in her hands she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton laid a kindly hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;Come, my dear, we
      can do no good by giving way to weeping. I have been through many of the
      refuge camps, and I shall go right on searching now. You see there are
      thousands of people in these Presidio grounds. He may be within a stone&rsquo;s
      throw of us here at this very moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me help you.&rdquo; With a hand she dashed away her tears,
      and stood before him now, calm and resolute. &ldquo;I will come with you
      right now. I need no hat or anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is all right He is resting quite peacefully. Just spare one
      moment, please. Come in and shake hands. He will be so happy to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to the tent door and parted the awning. Buell Hampton
      entered and warmly greeted General Holden. But he told him he could not
      linger, for Roderick must be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the remaining hours of daylight the Major and Gail searched along
      row after row of tents. But Roderick remained undiscovered&mdash;no one
      had ever heard his name or could remember having seen anyone answering to
      the description given. Reluctantly Buell Hampton quitted the quest and led
      Gail back to her own place of refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sleeping at Berkeley,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It is best
      that we should both have our night&rsquo;s rest. But I shall be back here
      for you soon after daybreak, and if you can engage someone to watch by
      your father we shall search together all day long. Will that suit, you,
      Gail?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are so kind taking me,&rdquo; she replied, resting her
      hands on his shoulders, tears of gratitude in the eyes that looked up into
      his. &ldquo;It would break my heart not to be with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not rob you of love&rsquo;s sweet duty,&rdquo; he replied
      as he stooped and gently kissed her on the brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day went by, but still their efforts were unrewarded. On the
      following morning they started for the Seal House, to search the many
      improvised hospitals which they had learned were located there. The first
      place they entered was an immense tent with two or three hundred cots
      ranged in crowded rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Buell Hampton and Gail walked down the long central aisle, each took
      one side to scan the physiognomies of the poor sufferers, some moaning in
      delirium, others with quiet pale faces that lighted up to return the smile
      of sympathy and encouragement Presently, the Major who was walking a few
      feet in advance heard an exclamation of joy, and turning quickly saw Gail
      Holden kneeling at the side of a cot There was a bewildered look on the
      face of the patient&mdash;a lean drawn face, pallid beneath the tan, the
      chin stubbled with a beard of a few days&rsquo; growth, the forehead
      swathed in bandages, one cheek scored with a healing scar. Gail had taken
      one of his hands in both her own. He looked from Gail to Major Hampton and
      then from the Major back to Gail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a vision?&rdquo; he asked feebly, as if doubting his
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick, my dear fellow, is it really you?&rdquo; exclaimed the
      Major, as he bent down over him. &ldquo;For days we have been hunting for
      you. And now we&rsquo;ve found your hotel&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced around
      with a little smile&mdash;&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t propose to lose sight of
      you again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Loosening his hand from Gail&rsquo;s and taking both of hers in his own
      and smiling feebly, Roderick said: &ldquo;Really, Gail, I hardly know yet
      whether you are actually here or I am dreaming. You looked pretty white
      that day I carried you from the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no dream about me, Roderick,&rdquo; replied Gail brightly.
      &ldquo;We are going to take care of you, Major Hampton and myself, just as
      you so kindly looked after poor little me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a nurse approached: &ldquo;So your friends have found you,
      Mr. Warfield?&rdquo; she said with a cheerful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Roderick, &ldquo;the very best friends I have
      in all the world.&rdquo; As he spoke Gail felt the gentle pressure of his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your ward?&rdquo; inquired the Major of the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have had charge of it ever since this makeshift hospital was
      put up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how is the patient, our friend Mr. Warfield?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had received a pretty ugly cut&mdash;a falling piece of wood or
      something of that sort&mdash;on the top and side of his head&mdash;a sort
      of glancing bruise. But he is getting on very well now. We have his fever
      under control. For a number of days he was very flighty and talked a great
      deal about Major Hampton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am honored,&rdquo; said the Major, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are Major Hampton?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gail, &ldquo;Major Buell Hampton is Mr. Warfield&rsquo;s
      best friend&mdash;that is, one of the best.&rdquo; And she looked quickly
      at Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fortunate that you have come when he is convalescing. But tell
      me,&rdquo; asked the nurse, &ldquo;who is Gail? In his delirium he talked
      a great deal about her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick&rsquo;s face flushed, and Gail with rising color immediately
      changed the subject by asking: &ldquo;How soon would it be safe to have
      the patient removed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perhaps tomorrow or the next day. The doctor says he is now
      quite out of danger&mdash;the fever is practically gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Roderick&rsquo;s request he was propped up on his little white iron
      hospital cot, chairs were brought, and until far on in the afternoon Gail
      and the Major sat on either side, conversing in quiet, subdued tones,
      relating incidents in the terrible disaster, planning for their early
      return to Wyoming just as soon as Gail&rsquo;s father and Roderick himself
      could stand the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days later Buell Hampton and Gail arrived at the hospital in
      an automobile, and carried Roderick away to a yacht anchored in the bay
      that had been placed at their disposal. Here Roderick found General Holden
      already installed in a comfortable deck chair, and he was introduced by
      Gail to her Uncle Edward, a hale old gentleman bearing a striking
      resemblance to his brother. The General looked fit even if he did carry
      his right arm in a sling, Roderick although weak from loss of blood was
      able to walk, and both could well congratulate each other on their
      providential escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not going to talk about these awful times,&rdquo; said the
      General as he gave Roderick his left hand and returned the cordial
      pressure. &ldquo;But I have to thank you for saving our dear Gail. We all
      fully realize that without your brave and timely help we would not have
      her with us today.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; protested Roderick. &ldquo;Somebody else would
      have done what I did. I was just happy and lucky in having the privilege.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; murmured the father, again pressing the hand
      which he had not yet relinquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so say I,&rdquo; exclaimed the uncle. &ldquo;We could not do
      without our little Gail.&rdquo; And he patted her cheek affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a week of blissful rest and happy companionship, at the end
      of which it would have been a hollow mockery to pretend in the case of
      either invalid that any more nursing or lolling in long chairs was
      required. Railroad accommodations were secured for the morrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX&mdash;REUNIONS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>EN days before the
      departure from San Francisco telegrams had been sent in all directions
      giving forth the glad tidings that General Holden and Gail, Roderick and
      Buell Hampton, were safe and would soon be on their homeward way to
      Wyoming. Among those thus notified had been the Shields family at Los
      Angeles and Allen Miller at Keokuk. But it was a great surprise to find
      Whitley Adams waiting the arrival of the morning train at Rawlins with his
      big Sixty Horse Power automobile, and bearing the news that Mrs. Shields,
      Barbara and Dorothy had returned, while also Uncle Allen and Aunt Lois had
      come to Encampment so that appropriate welcome might be given to those who
      had recently come through such terrible and harrowing experiences. Jim
      Rankin and Tom Sun were also on the platform to exchange hand-grips with
      Roderick and the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first glad salutations Whitley pointed to his car, and announced
      that he was going to drive the party over to Encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to be starting in opposition to the regular stage,&rdquo; he
      said with a sly little wink in Roderick&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;But you
      see Mr. Rankin&rsquo;s horses are hardly good enough for the occasion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim drew himself up and pointed to his old Concord stage coach standing
      by, all ready for the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dangnationest finest pair uv roan leaders and span uv blacks at
      the wheel that ever had lines over &lsquo;em in this part of the country,&rdquo;
      he declared sturdily. &ldquo;Just wait a bit, young man. &lsquo;Fore we&rsquo;re
      many miles on the road I make free to prognosticate you&rsquo;ll be under
      the bed-springs uv that new fangled wagon uv yours and my hosses will be
      whizzing past you like a streak uv greased lightnin&rsquo;. How would a
      little bet uv ten or twenty dollars suit you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bankers never gamble,&rdquo; replied Whitley with undisturbed
      gravity. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll follow with the luggage, Mr. Rankin,
      and no doubt we&rsquo;ll have the pleasure of seeing you again sometime
      tomorrow. Come away, Miss Holden. Luncheon is to be waiting at my hotel in
      Encampment in a couple of hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame his skin,&rdquo; muttered Jim when the big automobile had
      whirled away. But Tom Sun was convulsed with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got your dander fairly riz, Jim,&rdquo; he chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim&rsquo;s visage expanded into a broad grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s just what he was arter. But ain&rsquo;t he the
      most sassy cock-a-whoop little cuss anyhow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I help you with the luggage?&rdquo; laughed Tom Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you just quit the foolin&rsquo; game, Tom. Don&rsquo;t come
      nachural from you. Besides I might be gettin&rsquo; a heap peevish and
      kind o&rsquo; awkward with my artillery. Suppose we lubricate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the old cronies crossed over to the Wren saloon, where a brace of
      cocktails soon restored Jim&rsquo;s ruffled dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the automobile was speeding along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was on the driver&rsquo;s seat beside Whitley, and absorbing the
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I just insisted on your Uncle Allen coming along,&rdquo;
      Whitley was telling him. &ldquo;And Aunt Lois, too. My old folks will
      arrive at the end of the week. Meantime Aunt Lois is helping me with my
      trousseau.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your trousseau!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;socks and things. You see it&rsquo;s all fixed up between
      me and dear Dorothy. Oh, she&rsquo;s the best girl ever&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      remember I said that from the first, Rod, my boy.&rdquo; His face became
      grave, and his voice took a humble tone. &ldquo;Of course I know I can
      never, fill the place of Grant Jones, and I told her that. But I&rsquo;ll
      do my best to make her happy, and I think she cares enough for me to let
      me try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick pressed the hand next him resting on the steering wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be very happy, both of you,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;and I congratulate you, Whitley, old fellow, from the bottom
      of my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitley looked round and was his gay, light-hearted self once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, old chap. Well, Barbara and Ben Bragdon are also ready. We&rsquo;re
      only waiting for you and Gail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick&rsquo;s face reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mighty kind but rather premature, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fudge and nonsense! We&rsquo;re all agreed the thing&rsquo;s
      settled, or as good as settled. Great guns anyone with half an eye could
      have told it, to see you handing her out of the train a little while ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Whitley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, just forget all that. So when talking matters over with
      Bragdon and our dear twins I suggested that we might as well ring the
      wedding bells for six as for two at a time&mdash;may come cheaper with the
      Reverend Grannon, you know, if we hand it to him wholesale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick no longer attempted to protest, and Whitley rambled on: &ldquo;But,
      say, old fellow, your Uncle Allen has one on you. He declares that Gail
      Holden is just the very girl he intended for you right from the beginning&mdash;the
      young lady about whom you kicked when you had that row in the banker&rsquo;s
      room a year and a half ago&mdash;Great Scott, how time does fly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick in profound amazement
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same,&rdquo; replied Whitley. &ldquo;The little tot of a
      girl with whom you had that desperate love affair down the river years and
      years ago&mdash;oh, quite a pretty story; your uncle told it to me with no
      end of charming details. And now he is mighty proud, I can tell you, over
      his own foresight and sagacity in picking just the right girl for you at
      the very start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that, did he?&rdquo; queried Roderick with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that if you had followed his advice you could have had her
      then, without running away from home and facing all sorts of hardships and
      dangers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick firmly. &ldquo;Gail Holden is
      not that sort of girl. Uncle Allen forgets that she had to be won&mdash;or
      rather has to be won,&rdquo; he added, correcting himself when he caught
      the smile on Whitley&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; laughed Whitley, &ldquo;that I
      stood out of the contest and left the way clear for you. Lucky, though,
      that the College Widow took the bit between her teeth and bolted, eh, old
      man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered Roderick, throwing a warning glance over his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you two boys talking about?&rdquo; asked Gail, with a
      bright smile from her seat at the back of the tonneau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old college days,&rdquo; laughed Whitley, as he changed the clutch
      for a stiff up-grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at Encampment, they found Allen Miller walking nervously up and
      down the platform in front of the hotel. The red blood in Roderick&rsquo;s
      veins surged like fierce hammer strokes, with eagerness to once more grasp
      the hand of his old guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily excused himself, jumped from the auto and grasped the extended
      hand of his old guardian. He was soon led away by his uncle Allen, to the
      parlors of the hotel, to meet his Aunt Lois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad you brought Roderick here, Allen; for I just knew
      that I would get all fussed up and cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Aunt Lois,&rdquo; said Roderick cheerily, after
      embracing her warmly, &ldquo;we are not going to be separated any more,&mdash;or,
      if we are, it will not be for long at any one time. I know the way back to
      old Keokuk,&rdquo; said Roderick, laughing and hugging his dear aunt Lois
      again, &ldquo;and you and Uncle Allen now know the road out to the Wyoming
      hills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Lois,&rdquo; said Uncle Allen, &ldquo;you and Roderick
      act like a couple of school children.&rdquo; He laughed rather loudly as
      he said this, to hide his own agitation; but it was noticed that his eyes
      were filled with tears, which he hastily brushed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a happy luncheon party at the Bonhomme Hotel, Whitley playing the
      host to perfection, his guests, besides the new arrivals, being the whole
      Shields family, Banker Allen Miller and his wife, and the young state
      senator, Ben Bragdon. And early in the proceedings Gail to her surprise
      learned that Roderick was no other than her little boy lover on the river
      steamer <i>Diamond Joe</i> some fifteen years ago, and blushed in sweet
      confusion when Allen Miller in radiant good humor joked about coming
      events casting their shadows before. Roderick went to her rescue and
      promptly switched the topic of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of the meal Buell Hampton was expounding to the banker a
      great irrigation scheme he had in view&mdash;to bring into Encampment
      Valley the waters of French Creek and Bear Creek, the former by a tunnel
      through the Hunter Range, the latter by a siphon under the Great Platte
      River, whereby a hundred thousand acres of rich valley lands, now
      wilderness because waterless, could be brought into profitable
      agricultural bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are going to drive us cattle men off the face of the
      country,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better happy homes than roaming herds,&rdquo; replied Buell
      Hampton. &ldquo;What nobler work could we take in hand?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;The smelter and the mine are running themselves now. Let us then
      see what we can do to make the desert blossom like the rose. Mr. Miller,
      Mr. Shields, myself&mdash;we can all help with capital. Mr. Bragdon, there
      is a life&rsquo;s work for you in this enterprise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawyers always come in for fat pickings,&rdquo; laughed Whitley
      Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Holden,&rdquo; continued the Major, &ldquo;I am sure will
      want to join in too. Then Roderick&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and glanced in his young friend&rsquo;s direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m prepared to turn in all the gold from my mine,&rdquo;
      exclaimed Roderick enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed Buell Hampton had kindled the spirit of enthusiasm all round. The
      project was as good as launched&mdash;the dream of a generation of
      pioneers within sight of realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      When coffee was being served on the veranda, the Major drew Roderick
      aside. They were seated alone at a little table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick, my boy,&rdquo; Buell Hampton began, &ldquo;I want to see
      you tonight at my home&mdash;all alone. Come about eight o&rsquo;clock. I
      have several matters of importance to communicate. During the afternoon I&rsquo;ll
      be busy&mdash;I have some banking business to transact, besides I wish an
      hour or two with your uncle before my talk with you tonight. I am sorry to
      leave such a happy gathering, but am sure&rdquo;&mdash;this with a gentle
      glance in Gail&rsquo;s direction&mdash;&ldquo;that the time will not hang
      heavily on your hands. Until eight o&rsquo;clock then;&rdquo; and with a
      tap on Roderick&rsquo;s shoulder the Major crossed over and spoke a few
      words to Allen Miller, the two taking their departure a few moments later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick was mystified&mdash;less by Buell Hampton&rsquo;s actual words
      than by his grave look and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Gail had risen and entered the drawing room that opened by
      French windows off the veranda, and the sound of her voice at the piano
      broke him from his momentary reverie. He rose and joined her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL&mdash;BUELL HAMPTON&rsquo;S GOOD-BY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ODERICK was prompt
      to the minute in keeping his appointment. He found the Major seated before
      a bright log-fire, and his first glance around the old familiar room
      showed the progress of some unusual preparations. The open lid of a
      traveling trunk revealed clothing and books already packed; the violin in
      its case rested on the centre table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton interpreted his visitor&rsquo;s look of wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Roderick,&rdquo; he said with a smile that was both tender and
      serious, &ldquo;I am going away. But let us take things in their order.
      Sit down here, and let us smoke our pipes together in the old way&mdash;perhaps
      it may be for the last time in each other&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that, my dear Major,&rdquo; protested Roderick,
      in accents of real concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Buell Hampton motioned him to his seat, and passed over the humidor.
      For a minute or two they smoked in silence. At last the Major spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick, I have news that will greatly surprise you. I had a
      telegram from Boney Earnest just before we left San Francisco. I said
      nothing to you, for I did not wish with needless haste to disturb your
      happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not about Gail?&rdquo; asked Roderick, his face paling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. This has nothing to do with Gail&mdash;at least it only
      affects her indirectly. You spoke today at lunch time about turning in the
      profits of your gold mine into the Encampment Valley irrigation scheme. I
      want to put you right on this mining matter first. Boney Earnest&rsquo;s
      telegram showed that neither you nor I have a gold mine any longer. Hidden
      Valley has disappeared. Our claims are under five hundred feet of water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could this have happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read in the newspapers that the cosmic disturbances of the
      San Francisco earthquake extended entirely across the continent. Indeed
      the shocks were felt distinctly in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and
      other Atlantic points. Well, a number of prospectors have been up among
      the mountains getting ready to stake around our claims, and they report
      that three miles above Spirit Falls a vast new lake has been formed,
      completely filling the canyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shake brought down the grotto cavern, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sealed it, damming back the river. That is undoubtedly what has
      happened. So Roderick, my dear fellow, you have to forget that gold. But
      of course you know that all I have is yours to share.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Major,&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, laying a hand on his
      friend&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Besides your all too generous gift at
      Denver, I have my salary from the smelter company, and I&rsquo;m going to
      chip in to the limit of my power for the advancement of that glorious
      irrigation scheme of yours. I did without the mine before. Thank God I can
      do without it now. My dear father&rsquo;s letter served its purpose&mdash;it
      brought me to Wyoming, and although I have no right to say so just yet I
      do believe that it has won for me Gail Holden&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; remarked Buell Hampton quietly. &ldquo;She
      has loved you for a long time&mdash;you were all in all to her before you
      followed to San Francisco, as the poor girl&rsquo;s anguish showed during
      those days when we both thought that you had perished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Major,&rdquo; cried Roderick, the light of great joy
      illuminating his countenance, &ldquo;if I have won Gail Holden&rsquo;s
      love I have won greater treasure than the treasure of Hidden Valley&mdash;greater
      treasure than all the gold claims in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken like a man,&rdquo; replied Buell Hampton as he gripped
      Roderick&rsquo;s hand. The latter continued, his face all aglow: &ldquo;Everything
      has come out right When my Unde Allen refused to help me in my New York
      ventures he really saved me from cruel and accursed Wall Street where more
      hearts have been broken and lives of good promise wrecked than on all the
      battlefields of the world. When he handed me my father&rsquo;s letter, he
      took me out of that selfish inferno and sent me here into the sweet pure
      air of the western mountains, among men like you, the Reverend Stephen
      Grannon, Ben Bragdon, Boney Earnest, and good old Jim Rankin too, besides
      our dear dead comrade Grant Jones. Here I have the life worth living,
      which is the life compounded of work and love. Love without work is
      cloying, work without love is soul-deadening, but love and work combined
      can make of earth a heaven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you speak like a philosopher,&rdquo; said Buell Hampton
      approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which shows that I have been sitting at your feet. Major, for a
      year past not altogether in vain,&rdquo; laughed Roderick. &ldquo;From
      every point of view I owe you debts that can never be repaid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me improve this occasion by just one thought, Roderick. It
      is in individual unselfishness that lies the future happiness of mankind.
      The age of competition has passed, the age of combination for profit is
      passing, the age of emulation in unselfishness is about to dawn. The
      elimination of selfishness will lead to the elimination of poverty; then
      indeed will the regeneration of our social system be begun. Think that
      thought, Roderick, my dear fellow, when I am gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ever thus that Buell Hampton sought to sow the tiny grain of
      mustard seed in fertile soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you go away, Major?&rdquo; asked Roderick
      protestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because duty calls me&mdash;my work for humanity demands. But we
      shall come to that presently. For the moment I want to recall one of our
      conversations in this room&mdash;in the early days of our friendship. Do
      you remember when I gave it as my opinion that it would be conducive to
      the happiness of mankind if there was no abnormal individual wealth in the
      world?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That a quarter of a million dollars was ample for the richest man
      in the world&mdash;I remember every word, Major.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Roderick, today I have transferred to your credit in your
      Unde Allen&rsquo;s bank precisely this sum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major, Major, I could never accept such a gift.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just hear me patiently, please. The sum is quite rightfully yours.
      It is really only a small fraction of what your father&rsquo;s claim might
      have produced for you had I taken you earlier into my full confidence and
      so helped you to the location of the rich sandbar with its nuggets of
      gold. Moreover, you know me well enough to understand that I count wealth
      as only a trust in my hands&mdash;a trust for the good of humanity. And I
      feel that, in equipping such a man as yourself, a man whom I have tested
      out and tried in a dozen different ways without your knowing it&mdash;in
      equipping you with a sufficient competency I really help to discharge my
      trust, for I invest you with the power to do unmeasured good to all around
      you. I need not expatiate on such a theme; you have heard my views many
      times. In sharing my wealth with you, Roderick, I simply bring you in as
      an efficient helper for the uplift of humanity. It therefore becomes your
      duty to accept the trust I hand over to you, cheerfully and wishing you
      Godspeed with every good work to which you set your hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Major, I can but accept the responsibility. I need not tell
      you that I shall always try to prove myself worthy of such a trust.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have yet another burden to place on your shoulders. The balance
      of the wealth at my present disposal I have also handed over to you&mdash;as
      my personal trustee. At this moment I do not know when and in what amount
      I shall require money for the task I am about to undertake. Later on you
      will hear from me. Meanwhile Allen Miller knows that my initial investment
      will be equal to his own in the valley irrigation scheme. You, Roderick,
      as my trustee may contribute further sums at your absolute discretion; if
      the work requires help at any stage, use no stinting hand irrespective of
      financial returns for me, because with me the thing that counts mainly is
      the happiness and prosperity of this town, its people, and the surrounding
      valley lands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Major, can&rsquo;t you remain with us and do these things
      yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the call is preemptory. And if perchance you should never hear
      from me again, Roderick, continue, I beg of you, to use my money for the
      good of humanity. Count it as your own, use it as your own. I lay down no
      hard and fast rules to guide you. Give to the poor&mdash;give to those in
      distress&mdash;pay off the usurer&rsquo;s mortgage and stop excessive
      interest that makes slaves of the poor family struggling to own a little
      thatched cottage. Give wherever your heart is touched&mdash;give because
      it is God&rsquo;s way and God is prompting you by touching your heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick listened in silence, deeply moved. He saw that Buell Hampton&rsquo;s
      mind was made up&mdash;that no pleading or remonstrance could alter the
      decision at which he had arrived. The Major had now risen from his chair;
      there was a softness in the rich full tones of his voice, a look of half
      pain in his eyes, as he went on: &ldquo;But remember, although we may be
      parted, our friendship abides&mdash;its influences endure. Friendship, my
      dear Roderick, is elemental&mdash;without commencement and without end&mdash;a
      discovery. From the beginning of furthest antiquity, the pathway of the
      centuries have been lined with tablet-stones pronouncing its virtues.
      Friendship is the same yesterday, today, tomorrow and forever. It is an
      attraction of personalities and its power is unseen and as subtle as the
      lode-stone. It is the motive that impels great deeds of bravery in behalf
      of humanity. It speaks to the hearts of those who can hear its accents of
      truth and wisdom, and contributes to the highest ideals of honor, to the
      development of the sublimest qualities of the soul. It is the genius of
      greatness; the handmaiden of humanity. I have sometimes thought that if we
      could place in our own souls a harp so delicately attuned that as every
      gale of passion, of hope, of sorrow, of love and of joy swept gently over
      the chords, then we would hear in the low plaintive whisperings the melody
      of friendship&rsquo;s sweetest note&mdash;that quivers and weeps and
      laughs on the shore line of immortality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friendship, Major,&rdquo; said Roderick fervently, &ldquo;will
      always be one of the most deeply cherished things in my life. But I cannot
      reconcile myself to the thought that we should part.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buell Hampton laid a hand upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty calls&mdash;the two little words are enough, although it
      grieves me sore to think that most likely we shall never meet again. Your
      work is here&mdash;your usefulness lies here. But as for me, my mission in
      the hills is finished. I am going to a far away country&mdash;not a new
      one, because there are many in squalor and poverty where duty leads me.
      There I will begin again my labors for the lowly and the poor&mdash;for
      those who are carrying an unjust portion of life&rsquo;s burdens. There is
      no lasting pleasure in living, my dear Roderick, unless we help hasten the
      age of humanity&rsquo;s betterment. Good-by,&rdquo; concluded the Major,
      smiling into Roderick&rsquo;s eyes and pressing his hand warmly&mdash;&ldquo;good-by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost dazed by the suddenness of the parting Roderick Warfield found
      himself out in the darkness of the night He was stunned by the thought
      that he had gripped his dear friend&rsquo;s hand perhaps for the last time&mdash;that
      there had gone out of his life the one man whom above all others he
      honored and loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed Buell Hampton from among the people of the hills. None of his
      intimates in or around Encampment ever saw him again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI.&mdash;-UNDER THE BIG PINE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the following
      afternoon Roderick saddled his pony Badger and rode over to the Conchshell
      ranch. The Holdens received the news of Buell Hampton&rsquo;s mysterious
      departure with deep regret; the Major had become very dear to their
      hearts, how dear they only fully realized now that he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was toward evening when Gail proposed that they go riding in the woods.
      The invitation delighted Roderick, and Fleetfoot and Badger were speedily
      got ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us follow the old timber road to the south,&rdquo; Roderick
      suggested. &ldquo;I want to show you, only a few miles from here, a
      beautiful lake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no such lake,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it is less than five miles away, and we shall christen it
      Spirit Lake, if you like the name, for it lies above Spirit Falls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dreaming. There is no such lake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show it to you. Come along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upward and onward he led her over the range. And when they gained the
      summit, there at their feet lay the great new lake about which Buell
      Hampton had told him, fully seven miles long and two miles wide, and not
      less than six or seven hundred feet deep as Roderick knew, for he had
      gathered nuggets of gold on the floor of the little canyon now submerged
      beneath the placid blue waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail gazed in silent admiration. At last she exclaimed: &ldquo;Spirit
      Lake! It is well named. It is more like a dream than reality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her from the saddle. They tethered their mounts in western
      fashion by throwing the reins over the horses&rsquo; heads. They were
      standing under the branches of a big pine, and again they gazed over the
      waters. At the lower end of the lake was a most wonderful waterfall,
      dashing sheer down some four hundred feet into Spirit River.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several minutes they continued to gaze in enraptured silence on the
      scene of tranquil beauty. Toward the east the forest was darkly purple&mdash;to
      the west, across the waters, the hills were silhouetted in splendid
      grandeur against a magnificent sunset. The whole range seemed clothed in a
      robe of finest tapestry. The sun was rapidly approaching the rim of the
      western horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afterglow of the red sunset marked paths of rippling gold on the
      waters. Vague violet shadows of dusk were merging over all. Nature was
      singing the lyric of its soul into things&mdash;crooning lake and
      mountains and forest-clad slopes to slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Gail who at last broke the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful, how supremely beautiful,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is the earthquake that has wrought all this wonderful
      change,&rdquo; explained Roderick&rsquo;. &ldquo;And now, dear Gail, I
      have a story to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, seating her on the turf by his side, under the big pine, where the
      waters lapped at their very feet, he proceeded to relate the whole
      romantic story of his father&rsquo;s lost find&mdash;his own lost claim.
      By the time the narrative was ended the sun had set behind the hills.
      Roderick rose, and giving his hands, helped Gail to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So all this wonderful treasure of Hidden Valley lies beneath these
      waters,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but for me the real treasure is here by my side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke these words his arm stole around her waist. She did not appear
      to notice his half timid embrace as together they stood viewing the
      panorama of a dying day. Presently he drew her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day and the night blend,&rdquo; he whispered softly as if
      fearful of disturbing the picture. &ldquo;Shall not our lives, sweetheart,&rdquo;
      asked Roderick with vibrant voice, &ldquo;likewise blend forever and
      forever?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail half turning lifted her slender hands to Roderick&rsquo;s cheeks and
      he quickly clasped her tightly in his strong arms and kissed her madly on
      lips, eyes and silken hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick, my lover&mdash;my king,&rdquo; said Gail through pearly
      tears of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little Gail,&rdquo; whispered Roderick, exultantly, &ldquo;my
      sweetheart&mdash;my queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the light of day vanished. The sounds of night began walking abroad
      in the world. Dusk wrapped these lovers in its mantle. The day slept and
      night brooded over forest, lake and hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little while they lifted the bridle reins of their mounts and turning
      walked arm in arm down the old timber road toward Conchshell ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They halted in the darkness and Roderick said: &ldquo;Do you mind, dear,
      if I smoke?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; was her cheery reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bit the cigar and struck a match. The fight reflected on Gail&rsquo;s
      radiant face. &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; he ejaculated as he tossed the
      match away, laughing softly. He had quite forgotten to light his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what did you see, Roderick, you silly fellow, that is so
      wonderful?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; said Roderick, &ldquo;the dearest little woman in the
      wide, wide world&mdash;my mountain song girl&mdash;who is going to be
      kissed with all the pent-up passion of a &lsquo;grizzly&rsquo; in just
      one-half second.&rdquo;

      AFTERWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Into the warp and woof of my story of the West, &ldquo;The Treasure of
      Hidden Valley,&rdquo; there have been woven a few incidents of the great
      calamity that some years ago befell the city of San Francisco. Perhaps
      some of my readers will care to peruse a more detailed description of that
      tragic happening.
    </p>
    <h3>
      W. G. E.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was on April 18,
      1906, that San Francisco was shaken by a terrible earthquake which in its
      final effects resulted in the city being cremated into cinders and gray
      ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling, gyrating, shaking and swaying vibrations, the swiftly
      following outbursts of fire, the cries of those pinned beneath fallen
      débris and of the thousands who were seeking to escape by fleeing into the
      parks and toward the open country, produced the wildest pandemonium.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there was no wind, yet a hundred fires originating at different
      points quickly grew into sheets of towering flame and spread to adjacent
      buildings, burning with demoniacal fierceness as if possessed by some
      unseen mysterious power, pouring forth red hot smoke until the prostrate
      city was melted into ruin by the intense heat of a veritable hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of April 17 and 18 had almost ended in San Francisco. It had
      been like many another night in that cosmopolitan city. Pleasure-seekers
      were legion,&mdash;negligent, care-free, wrapped in the outward show of
      things&mdash;part of it good&mdash;part of it not so good&mdash;some of it
      downright wicked as in Ancient Pompeii. Yet the hour was late&mdash;or
      early, whichever you will&mdash;even for San Francisco. The clock in the
      city hall had resounded forth five strokes. Peaceful folk were in the
      realm of dreams that precede awakening. The roistering hundreds of a
      drunken night had gathered in places of vice and were sleeping away the
      liquor fumes. The streets were almost deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great printing presses that had been reverberating with the thunders
      of a Jove, gathering and recording the news from the four quarters of the
      earth, had paused and all was still. Here and there morning papers were on
      the streets and the preliminary work was in progress of sending them forth
      to the front doorsteps of the homes of rich and poor, from one end of the
      city to the other. Then, without warning, just eighteen minutes after the
      city clock had tolled its five strokes, one of the greatest news items and
      tragedies of the world&rsquo;s history was enacted. An historical
      milestone of the centuries was on that eventful morning chiseled on the
      shore line of the Pacific Coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly from the womb of sleeping silence, from far below the earth&rsquo;s
      crust, just as the dawn of a new day began purpling the eastern sky, there
      came forth a rumbling and muttering of unearthly noises like the
      collapsing of palaces of glass or the clanking of giant chains. It came
      from beneath the entire city and was borne upward and abroad on the
      startled wings of a mysterious fear. It was a shrieking, grinding
      confusion of subterranean thunder, like the booming of heavy artillery in
      battle. It was deafening in its dreadfulness, and drove terror to the
      heart of the hardiest. It sounded to the affrighted people as if two
      mighty armies of lusty giants of the underworld were grappling in mortal
      combat and in their ferocious anger were unwittingly breaking the earth&rsquo;s
      fragile shell into yawning cracks and criss-cross fissures. Mount
      Tamalpais was fluttering like the wings of a snared pigeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the space of seconds, the whole populace awoke, excepting those who had
      answered the last call; for some there were, pinned under falling walls,
      who were overtaken by swift death in the very act of awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uncounted number that were crushed to death and had life&rsquo;s door
      closed to them forever, no one will ever know. In the forty-eight seconds
      that followed the beginning of the deep guttural bellowing of hideous
      noises from somewhere below the earth&rsquo;s surface, buildings rocked
      and heaved and twisted, while heavy objects of household furniture were
      tumbled across rooms from one corner to the other and the occupants
      helplessly tossed from their beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an awakening, such lamentations, such cursing, such prayers, and then
      into the debris-littered streets the multitude began pouring forth,
      half-clothed, wild and panic-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stunning shock, like a succession of startled heart-beats, lasted
      twelve seconds less than one minute, but those who experienced the ordeal
      say it seemed an eternity&mdash;forty-eight seconds&mdash;terrible seconds&mdash;of
      sickening, swaying suspense. A heaving earth, jerking, pulsing to
      and fro in mad frenzy, while countless buildings were swaying and keeping
      time to a wild hissing noise like the noise of boiling, blubbering fat in
      a rendering caldron.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the dawn of a new day abounding in hideous noises&mdash;detonations
      of falling masonry, the crash of crumbling, crushing walls, the shrieks of
      maimed and helpless victims&mdash;and all the people stupefied with a
      terrible fear, women weeping in hysterical fright and everyone expectant
      of they knew not what, unable to think coherently or reason, yet their
      voices filling the stricken city with cries and moans of heart-rending
      terror and lamentation. And all the while there came up from somewhere an
      unearthly threatening roar that awed the multitude into unnatural
      submissive bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of eight and forty seconds the frantically tossed earth quieted&mdash;became
      normal and was still. Some of the buildings righted and were quiescent,
      and a moment of silence followed, except for the crowing of cocks, the
      whinnying of frightened horses and the whining of cowering dogs. This
      condition, however, was only of momentary duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately the streets became a wild scene of turmoil as the
      half-clothed, half-crazed men, women and children went rushing up and down
      in every direction, they knew not why nor where. Doors were broken open to
      allow egress, shutters were slammed, windows were hastily raised, and like
      a myriad of ants the rest of the people who until now had been penned up,
      struggled forth into open ways&mdash;thinly clad, some almost naked,
      trembling, gazing about awe-stricken, looking each at his fellow,
      indifferent to the destruction going on about them, each filled with
      prayerful thankfulness for life. Then, like a rehearsed orchestra of many
      voices, there arose, seemingly in unison, a chorus of heart-piercing wails
      and calls from thousands of throats for loved ernes&mdash;loved ones lost
      who could not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pale light of that April dawn, this vast army of survivors, while
      chilled with outward cold, shivered also with an unspeakable inward dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the streets of proud San Francisco in every direction were huge
      masses of bricks, cornices, fallen ragged chimneys and walls, tumbled
      together in complex dykes of débris like the winrows of a hay field and
      interspersed with the dead and dying bodies of man and horse alike,
      vanquished in life&rsquo;s uneven contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later in the vicinity of the ten-million-dollar courthouse,
      crowds of frightened people gathered, attracted perhaps by the terrific
      thundering of the mammoth stone slabs and concrete sides and columns of
      the structure, as, in their loosened condition from the steel skeleton,
      they kept crashing down upon the street in riotous disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every block in the city held its tragedy, its silent evidence of a mighty
      internal upheaving of Goliath strength. There were hundreds of dead, while
      others lay maimed in tortured suffering, buried under wreckage, pinned
      down by the giant hands of the Angel of Destruction. The unfortunates
      still living were fastened like insects caught in traps, helpless, but
      hoping for relief, awaiting the unwritten chapter that was yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great earthquake of San Francisco had spent its force&mdash;its rude
      results lay in careless disheveled evidence on every hand&mdash;and now
      the nerve-strained, half-crazed and bewildered people caught the sound of
      fire bells clanging hurriedly into nearer distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire hose and the corps of hook and ladder men came rushing with all
      speed, drawn by frenzied horses, hastily turning street corners and
      dashing around fallen walls while the automatic fire bells were cutting
      the air in metallic, staccato beats of wildest alarm. Soon the throbbing
      of the fire engines began and false hope sprung rife in the hearts of the
      people. Those running south on Market Street paused in bewilderment, not
      knowing which way to go, for fire calls and flames were evident, not in
      one location nor two, but in hundreds at widely separated places
      throughout the erstwhile magnificent metropolis of the Occident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black columns of smoke began rising from ominous red furnace flames
      beneath, and curled lazily into the balm of the upper air, indifferent to
      the wails of the helpless unfortunates maimed and pinned beneath the
      wrecked buildings of a demolished and burning city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murky smoke like mourning crape hung mutely above, while beneath its
      canopy life&rsquo;s sacrificial offering lay prostrate, the dying and the
      dead. The consuming flames spread quickly, and the horror of the hopeless
      condition of the injured was soon apparent, while the sobs and cries of
      the doomed victims became maddening because of the very impotency to
      succor them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suddenness of it all did not give time for the rescuers. Then too, the
      smoke-blinded and half-choked people in the crowded, congested streets
      were stampeding toward the open country&mdash;to Golden Gate Park and the
      Presidio. Many of the trapped victims, well and strong, might have escaped
      but could not exert normal power to shake off the fetters that held them
      down under fallen wreckage too heavy for their hampered strength. It was a
      veritable bedlam, some cursing, some praying, most all crying loudly as if
      in crazed pain for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first paroxysm passed, the poor unfortunates seemingly became more
      patient, believing that relief would surely come. The crackling flames
      mounted higher and came alarmingly nearer. Finally, as the conflagration
      with a hurried sweep began to envelop these pinioned human beings, they
      shrieked in agony like lost souls in terrible anguish at a most horrible
      and certain death. Their voices rose with the rising of the flames until
      at last the piteous cries were hushed perforce, and only the crackling
      sound of burning wood and the forked tongues of raging red fire greeted
      the sun, that morning of April 18, as it climbed above the eastern
      mountains and looked upon the scene of woeful destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it any wonder that strong men wept? Is it to be marveled at that those
      separated from friends and relatives grew bewildered, frantic and crazed
      with grief and fear, and that chaos reigned supreme?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually amid the whirl of emotions there stepped forth men who until now
      had been stunned into silence and temporarily bereft of reason. The first
      staggering shock passed, they became possessed in a measure with calmness
      and courage. They girded their belts afresh and although many of them
      began by cursing the heartless, cruel fire and the terribleness of it all,
      they quickly and determinedly turned to the stupendous work of endeavoring
      to subdue its ravages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a new terror raised its ghostly head and held the people in a grip of
      deepest despair. The earthquake had broken the supplying water mains, and
      presently the city was without water and the fire engines and other
      fire-fighting apparatus were worthless junk. It was a grievous blow to
      momentarily raised hopes and courageous resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flames raged on with the fleetness of race horses, eating out the
      heart of the city, burning it into cinders, and cremating the flesh and
      bone of fallen victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamite was brought into use, gunny sacks and bedding of all sorts were
      saturated with water from barrels and tanks. Grappling hooks and human
      hands made up the armament of puny defense against the over-powering and
      masterful flames of annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against these feeble weapons, the grim demon of fire planned an attack of
      certain devastation. It was as if his Satanic Majesty with all his imps
      were in their ruthless cunning directing a fiendish work that would permit
      no record but death to the unfortunate, no record to the proud city but
      gaunt-ribbed skeleton buildings, red hot cinders and blackened ash heaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overturned stoves in a thousand houses throughout the residential
      districts had early started a multitude of fires and split the
      fire-fighters into many divisions, and therefore into less effective units
      in their futile efforts even partially to check the mighty master&mdash;the
      devouring tempest of fire that crackled and sported in its insatiable
      greed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still to follow yet another misfortune, an execrable crime&mdash;that
      of wicked inhuman incendiarism. At places flames burst forth kindled by
      the hands of a coterie of merciless ghouls. These inhuman devils added to
      the calamities heaped upon their fellows by setting fire to unburned
      dwellings whose owners had fled. There was neither necessity nor reason
      for their dastardly acts. With sponges soaked in kerosene, they did this
      damnable work&mdash;indulging dreams perhaps of greater loot, greed and
      avarice in their cruel eyes, blackest hell in their debauched hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning of this losing fight with terrors of the fire king,
      seemingly unconquerable, only one ray of hope was discernible&mdash;there
      was no wind from ocean or bay in San Francisco that April morning. The
      clouds that filled the heavens with ominous blackness were only stifling
      smoke from the burning buildings below.
    </p>
    <p>
      High above the crimson snake-tongued flames the black smoke hung like a
      pall, silent and motionless, while fringing it around far away in every
      direction was the clear blue sky, serene, unfathomable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the heroic work of fighting the fire demon progressed, it was soon
      discovered that the police were insufficient. Crowds of ghouls were
      pressing the firemen, while robbery, rapine and murder ran riot. Human
      blood that day was easily spilled. For the sake of pelf and plunder, life
      was cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boldness of this lawless condition brought about its own remedy.
      Strong men arose in their might. Under able leadership they quickly formed
      a committee of safety. The National Guard was sent to help them.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Fred Funston of the U. S. Army telegraphed to the Secretary of War
      for authority, and within three hours was hurrying United States troops
      into the burning city, and immediately placed it under martial law. The
      crowds were quickly driven back by the soldiers, fire lines were
      established, government troops, guards and police all bent nobly to the
      task of endeavoring to subdue the flames. Buildings were dynamited to shut
      off the fire&rsquo;s progress, insubordinate as well as predatory ruffians
      were shot down without mercy, and thus was order brought out of chaos. But
      as the hours went by, despite all efforts, the gormandizing flames
      consumed acres and acres of buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every wandering automobile was pressed into service and loaded with
      dynamite. Thus for hour after hour the losing fight with the merciless
      flames went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fire burnt its way south on Market Street, the isolated centers
      crept toward each other with ever widening circles of flame. While there
      was no breeze to fan them on, yet the flames seemed possessed of some
      invisible means of progression&mdash;an unseen spirit of continued
      expansion lurked within. The buildings were like so much dry timber,
      igniting without direct contact of spark or flame, only from the
      tremendous heat that was generated. Sweeping on and on the different
      conflagrations at last came together&mdash;joined in greater strength,
      flared up hundreds of feet high, until it looked as if the entire city was
      one vast molten lake of undulating waves of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roar of the flames could be heard far beyond the confines of the city&mdash;the
      immense columns and clouds of black smoke continued to sweep upward, until
      high aloft they spread out into the great canopy as if in shame they fain
      would hide from angels above the terrible destruction being wrought in
      this fiery pit below.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hours went by, the exodus of people continued. The fascination of
      it all held the multitudes spell-bound. They for a time were forgetful of
      hunger, but moved on, this way and that as the burning districts compelled
      them to go. The public parks began to fill with refugees. The Presidio and
      the hills overlooking the city were blackened with throngs of people
      shivering from cold and beginning to suffer the pangs of hunger, the rich
      and the poor touching shoulders, condoling one with the other in
      lamentations. This surging mass of famishing humanity were clothed, or
      partially clothed, in strange and ridiculous costumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Household goods littered the outlying streets. Most of the wayfarers who
      reached the country had little luggage. Many had carried some useless
      article nearest at hand, selected in their hurry without thought of its
      value or utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      One woman held a bird cage under her arm&mdash;empty, with the door
      swinging open. Another carried a carving knife in one hand and a
      feather-bedecked hat of gaudiness in the other. One man was seen dragging
      an old leather-bound trunk by a rope&mdash;investigation proved the trunk
      to be without contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the people had lost their all, and in most cases were
      famishing, yet the great mass were good-natured and tolerant, the strong
      helping the weak. The chivalry of the West and its rugged manhood abided
      in their midst There was a common brotherhood in the ranks of these
      homeless human beings. Distinctions between rich and poor were obliterated&mdash;they
      were all fellow refugees.
    </p>
    <p>
      No street cars were running in the city. Market Street, into which the
      greater number of street car railroad tracks converged, was littered with
      fallen buildings, useless hose and fire fighting apparatus, twisted beams,
      cinders, heaps of hot ashes and charred bodies of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the first day of this
      terrible devastation that the famous Palace Hotel had finally been emptied
      of its last guest. The rooms throughout were bestrewn with fallen plaster
      from ceiling and walls, but otherwise, strange to narrate, the structure
      had suffered but little damage from the earthquake while all around were
      collapsed and fallen buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Mission Street side of the building and on the roof the employees
      had fought bravely to save this noted hostelry. But as the noon hour
      approached they gave up all hope. Hurrying through the rooms of the
      departed guests in an endeavor to save, if possible, abandoned luggage,
      they gossiped about the &ldquo;yellow streak,&rdquo; as they called it, of
      a world-noted singer&mdash;a guest of the hotel&mdash;who had been
      frightened almost to death by the earthquake and developed evidence of
      rankest selfishness in his mad efforts to save himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in sadder tones they talked of the impending and inevitable
      destruction of the magnificent hotel, where most of them had been employed
      for years. As the heat from the on-sweeping flames began to be unbearable,
      they hurried away one by one until the famous caravansary was finally
      deserted by man and in full possession of the ruthless devouring flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great crowds stood on Montgomery Street near the site of the Union Trust
      Building and watched the burning of the Palace Hotel. Held back by the
      soldiers in mournful silence, the mass of people watched the angry flames
      leaping from roof and windows. Soon the fire spread to the Grand Hotel
      across the street. The flames shot up higher, and then when their task of
      destruction was finally finished, gradually sank down until nothing but
      roofless, windowless, bare bleak walls, gaunt, blackened and charred, were
      left&mdash;a grim ghost of the old hotel that boasted of a million guests
      during its gorgeous days of usefulness, and around which twined a thousand
      memories of the golden days of the Argonauts of California.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a block away a newspaper building had been blown up by dynamite&mdash;a
      similar attempt with the Monadnock Building failed of its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When night finally fell, those on the north side of Market Street rejoiced
      greatly, for it seemed that the fire, at least in the down-town business
      district, had burned itself into submission. So said a well-known milliner
      for men, as he ate a huge steak at a famous resort on the ocean shore and
      indulged heavily in champagne in celebration of the saving of his
      premises. He celebrated a day too soon&mdash;the following morning his
      business house was in ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the few who were care-free in the sense that they had not lost
      relatives or friends, the panorama of the fire when darkness came on will
      never be forgotten because of the wonderful pyrotechnic display&mdash;the
      magnificent yet appalling splendor and beauty of the burning city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was set as by a wonder-hand of stagecraft. The fire was raging
      fiercely in an immense pit&mdash;topographically the lowest part of the
      city. Around this pit the rising ground, like a Greek amphitheatre,
      stretched up toward the Sutro Estate and Ricon Hill on the one side and
      toward California Street, Nob and Telegraph Hills on the other. To the
      east was Alcatraz like a sentinel in the waters; across the Bay the cities
      of Alameda, Oakland and Berkeley. On every vantage point the people
      gathered&mdash;on the heights of Alcatraz and on the roofs of buildings in
      the trans-bay cities. In silence they gazed at the awe-inspiring drama of
      destruction that was being enacted before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the advance of night, the towering flames in this vast sweep of many
      miles of a circular fire line presented a scene that defies description.
      The general color effect was of a deep blood red, while the smoke as a
      background to the picture belched up in rolling black volumes, with here
      and there long forks of flashing fire shooting above the deep crimson glow
      of the mighty furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the roaring billows of flame the tallest buildings were as tinder
      wood in their helplessness. The Call Building, lifting its head high above
      its neighbors, was like an ignited match-box set on end. The living
      flaming wall behind overtopped it as a giant does a pigmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o&rsquo;clock! Ten o&rsquo;clock! Midnight!&mdash;and those who
      watched and waited and slept not, with nothing but excitement to stay
      their hunger, saw in the lurid light that by a flank movement the fire had
      unexpectedly crept far up Montgomery Street from the Ferry. The trade
      winds were stirring. The fire, in its pulsing undulations, presented the
      lure and the sensuous poetry of death. It barred all trespassing on the
      one side and burnt its way through on the other. It was seen that the
      entire banking district was doomed. Alas, the feeble protests of feeble
      men! It was a wild outlaw, untamed and untamable fire, that defied all
      human interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Chinatown&mdash;the world-noted Chinatown of San Francisco&mdash;what
      of that? It too had gone the way of annihilation. They say brutality was
      practiced, and it is whispered to this day that those in charge of
      dynamiting the Chinatown section of the city were careless and did not
      warn the inmates of opium dens&mdash;it is said they blew up many
      buildings that held within them, or in the grottoes beneath, innumerable
      inmates. Whether or not this is true no one can positively say. If true,
      there is some excuse. The Chinese dwellings were honey-combed underground
      with dark and devious passages, and it was perhaps impossible, for lack of
      time and dearth of knowledge how to penetrate these hidden recesses, to
      warn the drugged dreamers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this district the fire raged as if possessed by a million devils. Over
      the city&rsquo;s tenderloin on the edge of Chinatown, it swept with a
      flame of reckless wrath and purification. Buildings whose very timbers
      were steeped in vice and immorality burned into ashes of cleanliness. The
      haunts of the lustful, the wine-bibber and the dope-fiend were consumed in
      a fashion horrible, terrible, pitiless and final.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city was burned into scrap iron of contortioned steel beams, ragged
      chimneys half broken and heaps of blackened cinder. As the hours went by
      it seemed the fire continually found new fuel to feed upon in its savagery
      and madness. The accumulation of days and years of human labor crumbled
      into nothingness. Thousands, then hundreds of thousands, then millions,
      until the enormous total reached $600,000,000 of wealth that was melted
      away in this fiery crucible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Egypt, cursed by Moses and weeping for its firstborn, was in no more
      pitiable plight than this calamity-visited city of San Francisco shaken by
      earthquake shock, then swept by fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four and one-half miles one way the fire travelled, then four and one-half
      miles the other it burned its devastating way. Behind it in its path of
      ruin were only cracked granite walls, twisted steel girders, crumbling and
      broken cornices; before it, a scattering field of a few untouched
      buildings yet to conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Nero with an evil eye on a city&rsquo;s undoing, and the power of a
      wicked tyrant to fulfill his sordid wish, could have been no more ruthless
      in his dastardly heartless methods of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the fire was finally ended the buildings that had been burned, if
      placed in a row, would have extended for two hundred miles in a straight
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in the world&rsquo;s history has there been such a fire. The burning
      of ancient London was child&rsquo;s play beside it. Chicago&rsquo;s fire
      was a mere bagatelle. Never has the world read, never had the world
      dreamed, of such a conflagration. In days to come, grandfathers will tell
      of it to their grandchildren, nodding their sage old heads to emphasize
      the horror of it all, relating to the young people who gather about their
      knees, how great buildings supposed to be fire-proof crumpled up before
      the swirling sheets of melting flame and the entire city became a prey to
      the all-devouring conqueror. And this is the tragic story of proud San
      Francisco, cosmic-tossed and fire-beleaguered capital of the Occident.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  United States, you&rsquo;ll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

The Foundation&rsquo;s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
